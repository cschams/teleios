Introduction
============

Welcome to Teleios! This roleplaying game system is primarily geared
towards campaigns set anytime from the modern to the far-future,
however, it could be easily adapted to other settings with some slight
modifications. Given the versatility of this system, there are some
components that gamemasters (GMs) will want to include, while there are
others that are optional, depending on the style and flavor of the
campaign they are running. The rules that follow assume the reader has
familiarity with other tabletop roleplaying games, but effort will be
made at clarifying confusing points. Please enjoy reading these rules,
and feel free to comment and critique as necessary.

The Story
---------

Regardless of the specific campaign, Teleios is designed to be
story-driven. While the GM will be the prime storyteller, the players
will also have key roles in creating the campaign and story. The
collaboration between the GM and the players isn't one of competition
necessarily, but one of mutual creativity and fun. For example, rules
will exist in this game wherein the players are given the ability to
modify the story; in such a case, the players and the GM should
collectively agree on the story and plot changes that will be
introduced.

Skills Instead Of Classes
-------------------------

There are no classes in Teleios. Instead, player characters select
skills which depict what they are good at doing. A flexible skill-based
system offers characters more options for abilities, powers, and
knowledge versus being labeled as a "fighter" and succumbing to the
limitations that descriptor entails. A traditional "fighter" in Teleios
could not only be good at combat, but could also be a movie buff, a
dancer, and have an interest in the occult. Selecting skills in those
areas would not penalize this character as they might in other game
systems. Furthermore, a skill-based system is more "realistic" in that
everyone in reality has a wide panoply of skills, interest, and
abilities which are not easily shoehorned into a one-word label like
"medic," "mechanic," or "mystic."
