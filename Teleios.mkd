[INTRODUCTION]{.c1}

[Welcome to Teleios! This roleplaying game system is primarily geared
towards campaigns set anytime from the modern to the far-future,
however, it could be easily adapted to other settings with some slight
modifications. Given the versatility of this system, there are some
components that gamemasters (GMs) will want to include, while there are
others that are optional, depending on the style and flavor of the
campaign they are running. The rules that follow assume the reader has
familiarity with other tabletop roleplaying games, but effort will be
made at clarifying confusing points. Please enjoy reading these rules,
and feel free to comment and critique as necessary. ]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c1}

[THE STORY]{.c1}

[Regardless of the specific campaign, Teleios is designed to be
story-driven. While the GM will be the prime storyteller, the players
will also have key roles in creating the campaign and story. The
collaboration between the GM and the players isn't one of competition
necessarily, but one of mutual creativity and fun. For example, rules
will exist in this game wherein the players are given the ability to
modify the story; in such a case, the players and the GM should
collectively agree on the story and plot changes that will be
introduced. ]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c1}

[SKILLS INSTEAD OF CLASSES]{.c6 .c7}

[There are no classes in Teleios. Instead, player characters select
skills which depict what they are good at doing. A flexible skill-based
system offers characters more options for abilities, powers, and
knowledge versus being labeled as a "fighter" and succumbing to the
limitations that descriptor entails. A traditional "fighter" in Teleios
could not only be good at combat, but could also be a movie buff, a
dancer, and have an interest in the occult. Selecting skills in those
areas would not penalize this character as they might in other game
systems. Furthermore, a skill-based system is more "realistic" in that
everyone in reality has a wide panoply of skills, interest, and
abilities which are not easily shoehorned into a one-word label like
"medic," "mechanic," or "mystic."]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[THE GAME MECHANIC]{.c1}

[Players]{.c6}[ roll ]{.c0}[no fewer than one]{.c6 .c7}[ but ]{.c6}[no
more than twelve ]{.c6 .c7}[six-sided dice in or]{.c0}[der to perform
]{.c6}[actions]{.c6 .c7}[. Rolling dice is called a ]{.c0}[check]{.c6
.c7 .c13}[. The number of dice rolled is equal to ]{.c0}[the sum of a
character's rank in a Skill or psionic Power and its corresponding
Attribute, so more talent and training allows characters to roll more
dice, giving a greater chance of success. ]{.c6}[A result of 5 on a die
scores one ]{.c0}[hit]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[ and a result of 6 on a die scores
two hits. A result of 1 on a die subtracts one hit. Results of 2, 3, and
4 have no effect. After the check is made, the player adds all hits
together. The resulting number of hits determines, by degree, the level
of success (or failure) that results from the attempted action. ]{.c2
.c0}

-   [≤0 hits = Marginal/Failure.]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[ The attempted action
    does not succeed, and the GM gets to ]{.c0}[t]{.c6}[ake ]{.c0}[a
    ]{.c6}[reaction]{.c6 .c7}[. ]{.c0}[Reactions made by the
    GM]{.c6}[ ]{.c0}[are usually]{.c6}[ some sort of complication or
    detrimental effect to the characters. ]{.c0}[GM reactions]{.c6}[ can
    take many forms; for instance, the GM may decide that an enemy
    attacks a character, or that the character is noticed by an enemy.
    Conversely, maybe the GM decides that there is unwelcome news for
    the character, or the character suffers monetary or equipment loss.
    Generally speaking, the GM should design ]{.c0}[their
    reactions]{.c6}[ around the attempted action that a character
    attempted. Also no]{.c0}[te that depending on the circumstances, it
    may be impossible (or otherwise undesirable, for story reasons) for
    a character to "fail" a check outright; in such cases Teleios allows
    for a "marginal" success in which the player's action succeeds, but
    the GM is allowed to take ]{.c6}[two]{.c6 .c7}[ reactions as a
    result. ]{.c2 .c0}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [More about reactions: GM reactions may be "saved" for a later time,
    but the GM can only carry up to three saved reactions between game
    sessions. Like mentioned in "The Story" above, GM reactions, while
    proposed by the GM, should be ultimately agreed upon by the players
    and GM. ]{.c2 .c0}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [1-3 hits = Ordinary.]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[ The attempted action succeeds,
    but the GM gets to ]{.c0}[take one reaction]{.c6}[ as well.]{.c2
    .c0}
-   [4-5 hits = Good. ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[The attempted action
    succeeds]{.c0}[ with no accompanying GM reaction.]{.c6}
-   [6≤ hits = Amazing. ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[The attempted action succeeds
    with an added ]{.c0}[bonus]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[ to the character. The
    character can choose the form of the bonus
    (]{.c0}[considerin]{.c6}[g GM and group ]{.c0}[advice and
    consent]{.c6}[). For example, a character may decide that the
    attempted action succeeds to such a degree that the action requires
    less time, or stays in effect longer, or deals more damage, etc. As
    a rule of thumb, any bonus that adds to the efficacy of the
    attempted action should be no more than ]{.c0}[33% better]{.c6 .c7
    .c13}[. For example, if a Melee attack normally deals 1d6 (LI) body
    damage, an Amazing result would deal 1d6+2 (LI) body damage. The
    character might also decide that as a result of their
    a]{.c0}[maz]{.c6}[ing success, the next related action they]{.c0}[,
    or an ally, attempts]{.c6}[ has advantage.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[It is important to note that t]{.c6}[he GM n]{.c0}[ever
rolls]{.c6}[ dice. GM reactions are only taken as a result of
Marginal/Failure and Ordinary results from ]{.c0}[player actions.
]{.c6}[In cases where an enemy would attack a character, ]{.c0}[a player
rolls that]{.c6}[ character's appropriate defense to determine the
enemy's degree of success. The player would then roll damage dice for
their character as well. ]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[A note on rounding: In cases where rounding needs to take place,
]{.c6}[round in the way which tells a good story]{.c6 .c7}[. In other
cases, ]{.c6}[round to the benefit of the characters]{.c6 .c7}[. For
instance, if a character recovers half of their three used Luck points
during a rest, they would recover two of the used three. ]{.c6}

[]{.c1}

[ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE]{.c1}

[Certain situations may make it more or less likely for a character to
succeed at an action. In cases where the character has a greater chance
to succeed, this is called ]{.c0}[advantage ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[(abbreviated
]{.c0}[AD]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[), and in cases where the character has a
smaller chance to succeed, this is called ]{.c0}[disadvantage]{.c6 .c7
.c13}[ (abbreviated ]{.c0}[DA]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[). When making a check with
advantage, results of 4 add one hit to the total, whereas normally they
have no effect. When making a check with disadvantage, results of 5 have
no effect, whereas normally they score one hit. If a character would be
granted advantage or disadvantage from multiple sources, its effects are
only applied once\--]{.c0}[there is no such thing as "super
advantage]{.c6}[!]{.c0}["]{.c6}[ If a character has both advantage and
disadvantage on a check, even from ]{.c0}[multiple sources,]{.c6}[ the
two cancel each other out and the check is rolled as normal.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[LUCK]{.c1}

[Characters have a number of luck points (LP) equal to their AGI+3. When
a character makes a check and dislikes the result, they may choose to
spend a luck point to do one of the following actions:]{.c2 .c0}

-   [Automatically add two hits to the result of the check]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Re-roll any dice of the player's choosing in the check and use the
    new result]{.c2 .c0}

[Only one luck point may be spent on any given check; for instance, a
character could not spend two luck points to add four hits to a check.
Likewise, if a player chooses to reroll some dice from their check, they
must use the new result and cannot use a second luck point to reroll
again. Characters regain one used luck point ]{.c0}[when taking a rest,
and restore all of their available luck points upon achieving a
milestone.]{.c6}

-   [NOTE: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[Cybered characters who activate a piece of
    ]{.c0}[CyberWare]{.c6}[ (and therefore add dice to their pool)
    ]{.c0}[are able to]{.c6}[ reroll ALL of their dice when spending LP,
    including their added dice from their
    ]{.c0}[CyberWare]{.c6}[ activation.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[ATTRIBUTES]{.c1}

[All characters have four basic attributes: Fortitude (FORT), Agility
(AGI), Intellect (INT), and Personality (PERS). Character scores in
these attributes can range from 1-6; however, as a ]{.c0}[starting
character]{.c6 .c7}[ no attribute may begin play above rank 4. Details
on the attributes are below.]{.c2 .c0}

-   [Fortitude (FORT)]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[ represents a character's strength,
    toughness, and stamina. FORT is important for the Athletics,
    Endurance, and Melee skills. It is also a factor in melee damage,
    calculating ma]{.c0}[ximum pieces of]{.c6}[ ]{.c0}[CyberWare]{.c6}[,
    body and stun durability, actions per round, and physical
    defense.]{.c2 .c0}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [Expertise Perks: ]{.c1}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [When FORT is referenced as part of a check for skills  (for
    example, when rolling damage for the Melee skill), this perk allows
    the character to use 2x their FORT score, rather than just their
    FORT score. So a character with this Expertise Perk and a FORT score
    of 4 would add 8 to damage from the Melee skill rather than 4.]{.c2
    .c0}
-   []{.c1}

[]{.c1}

-   [Agility (AGI) ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[represents a character's quickness,
    balance, and speed. AGI is important for the Acrobatics, Ranged,
    Stealth, Thievery, and Vehicles skills. It is also used to calculate
    luck points, initiative order, and physical defense.]{.c2 .c0}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [Expertise Perks:]{.c1}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [When AGI is used to add to a roll as part of a skill check (for
    example, when rolling ranged damage), this perk allows the character
    to use 2x their AGI score, rather than just their AGI score. So a
    character with this Expertise Perk and an AGI score of 4 would add 8
    to Ranged damage.]{.c6}

[]{.c1}

-   [Intellect (INT) ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[represents a character's knowledge,
    adaptability, and rational thinking. INT is important for the
    Bureaucracy, Computers, Deduce, ]{.c0}[Humanities]{.c6}[, Medicine,
    Outdoors, Science, Search, Tactics, and Technology skills. It is
    also important for calculating beginning XP, initiative order, some
    psionic]{.c0}[ skills]{.c6}[, and mental defense.]{.c2 .c0}

```{=html}

```
-   [Linguist: ]{.c6 .c7}[The character knows an additional 2 languages
    (this perk may be taken more than once).]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c1}

-   [Personality (PERS)]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[ represents a character's
    willpower, sanity, and charisma. PERS is important for the Animals,
    Charm, Deception, Occult, Resolve, and Streetwise skills. It factors
    into a character's mental defense, actions per round]{.c0}[,
    some]{.c6}[ psionic]{.c0}[ skills]{.c6}[, and stun durability.]{.c2
    .c0}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [Expertise Perks:]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[OPTIONAL ATTRIBUTES]{.c1}

[Additionally, all characters have two optional attributes: Cyberware
(CYB) and Psionics (PSI). A player may choose to acquire ranks in PSI or
CYB or both (or neither), whether at character creation or later as the
character gains XP. Both PSI and CYB may be increased in rank from 1-6;
however, if a character has ranks in both PSI and CYB, the]{.c0}[ sum of
those two cannot exceed 6]{.c6 .c7}[. For instance, a character choosing
to specialize in ]{.c0}[CyberWare]{.c6}[ may have a CYB score of 6, but
that same character would then be prohibited from acquiring any psionic
abilities whatsoever. Specific details on the optional attributes are
described later ]{.c0}[in the Psionics and CyberWare sections,
respectively]{.c6}[.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[DEFENSES]{.c1}

[Characters have two defenses that are checked when they are attacked by
enemies or by the environment: physical defense (]{.c0}[PD]{.c6 .c7
.c13}[) and mental defense (]{.c0}[MD]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[). A character
checks their physical defense when an enemy targets their body (such as
with a ]{.c0}[M]{.c6}[elee or ]{.c0}[R]{.c6}[anged attack). A character
checks their mental defense when an enemy targets their willpower or
sanity (such as with Deception or certain psionic attacks). Both
physical and mental defense range from 2-12 dice (FORT+AGI for physical
defense and INT+PERS for mental defense). When a check is necessary, the
character rolls the appropriate defense and calculates levels of success
as normal. The result (Failure, Ordinary, Good, or Amazing) dictates the
effect of the attack on the character.]{.c2 .c0}

-   [Marginal/Failure = ]{.c6 .c7}[The character suffers the negative
    effects of the attack, and also suffers an additional setback from
    the attack. Examples might include rolling DA on their next check,
    or else amplifying the negative effects of the attack by an
    additional 33%. The additional setback should be story-driven and
    should be collaboratively decided between the player and GM.]{.c2
    .c0}
-   [Ordinary = ]{.c6 .c7}[The character suffers the negative effects of
    the attack, but no further setback.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Good = ]{.c6 .c7}[The character does not suffer any negative
    effects from the attack.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Amazing = ]{.c6 .c7}[The character does not suffer any negative
    effects from the attack. Additionally, the character may roll their
    next check with AD ]{.c6}[or]{.c6 .c7}[ may negate the next reaction
    taken by the GM (player chooses).]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[INITIATIVE & ACTIONS]{.c1}

[Combat encounters are divided into "rounds." Each round in combat is
equal to ]{.c0}[20]{.c6}[ seconds in game time; therefore,
]{.c0}[3]{.c6}[ rounds equal 1 minute. Furthermore, each round of 20
seconds is divided into ]{.c0}[four]{.c6}[ "phases," each lasting
]{.c0}[5]{.c6}[ seconds. The ]{.c0}[four]{.c6}[ phases in each round
relate to one of the degrees of success; in order, the Amazing, Good,
Ordinary, and Margina]{.c0}[l degrees]{.c6}[. In cases where it is
important to know who acts first, such as in a combat, characters roll
an initiative (]{.c0}[INIT]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[) check. Initiative ranges
from 2-12 dice, and is calculated by ]{.c0}[AGI+INT]{.c6 .c7}[. When a
check is necessary, the character rolls initiative and calculates levels
of success as normal. The result (Amazing, Good, Ordinary, or Marginal)
]{.c0}[dictates the phase]{.c6}[ in which characters may make their
actions. ]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c1}

[When combat begins, all characters involved roll INIT. The result of
that check (Amazing, Good,]{.c0}[ Ordinary, or Marginal]{.c6}[)
determines the phase in which that character can first act. Thereafter,
characters may make an action in any subsequent phase (provided they
have actions available). So, if a character rolls a Good result on
th]{.c0}[eir initiative check]{.c6}[, they cannot act in the Amazing
phase (which comes first), but can take an action when the Good phase
comes up. Since there are only ]{.c0}[four]{.c6}[ phases per combat
round, it is likely that multiple characters (and enemies) will act in
the same phase. All actions in a phase are considered to occur
simultaneously, with the effects of those actions taking effect at the
end of the phase. So, if a character and an enemy NPC both successfully
attack each other in the Ordinary phase, both receive damage at the end
of th]{.c0}[at]{.c6}[ phase but before the start of the Marginal phase.
]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[In all combat phases, a character ]{.c0}[may]{.c6}[ move and attempt an
action. Some mo]{.c0}[des of movement (running, jumping, etc.) can
impose disadvantage on various checks. ]{.c6}[A character can make as
many actions per round as they have actions available (see Actions per
Round). So, if a character has two actions per round and rolls a Good
result on their INIT check, they can begin to take actions beginning in
the Good phase. Thereafter, the second action could be taken in the
Ordinary phase or the Marginal phase (]{.c0}[player choice)]{.c6}[. That
equates to (as an example):]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

-   [One action in each the Good and Ordinary phases]{.c0}
-   [One action in each the Good and Marginal phases (delaying the
    second action)]{.c0}
-   [One action in each the Ordinary and Marginal phases (delaying both
    actions)]{.c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Note that if a character first acts in the Marginal phase (the last
combat phase), they can only take one action that round. This may mean
that characters lose actions because they didn't act quickly enough. At
the end of the Marginal phase (and therefore the combat round), all
participating combatants re-roll their INIT and the next round begins
with the Amazing phase. ]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Some situations, skills, and CyberWare can grant characters a Surprise
round. A Surprise round in combat is granted due to superior
positioning, preparation, and/or guile. A Surprise round occurs before
the Amazing round in a combat scene. Each character and NPC
participating in a Surprise round can move and take one action as
normal, but those actions are rolled with advantage against all who do
not act. A character acting in a Surprise round against an NPC also
acting in the Surprise round would gain the extra movement and action,
but would not roll that action with advantage. ]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[SKILLS]{.c1}

[Nearly everything characters can do in ]{.c0}[Teleios]{.c6}[ is
represented by skills. Each skill is tied to one of the four basic
attributes and can have a rank of 0 (untrained) to 6. ]{.c0}[A beginning
character cannot have a skill with a rank higher than 4.]{.c6 .c7}[ When
making a skill check, the character adds the number of ranks in the
selected skill (between 0 and 6) with their rank in the linked attribute
(between 1 and 6) and rolls that many dice for the check. As an example,
a character who makes a Ranged check adds their ranks in the Ranged
skill with their ranks in AGI (the linked attribute). Note that this
same basic system is used for psionic powers, w]{.c0}[ith a couple of
notable changes (see Psionics below).]{.c6}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[UNTRAINED]{.c1}

[When a character has 0 ranks in a skill or psionic power, they are
considered to be ]{.c0}[untrained]{.c6 .c7}[. In some cases a character
may not use a skill untrained (as in the case of psionic powers). In all
other cases, ]{.c0}[using a skill untrained imposes disadvantage]{.c6
.c7}[ on the skill check.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[PERKS]{.c1}

[Perks are special, unique abilities associated with skills, psionic
powers, and attributes that players can tailor to their character
concept and style of play (pending GM approval). There are
t]{.c0}[wo]{.c6}[ levels of perks: training
perks]{.c0}[ and]{.c6}[ expertise perks.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Training Perks]{.c1}

[Training perks only apply to skills. When a character is trained (has
at least one rank) in a skill, they have the opportunity to purchase
training perks. Training perks are]{.c0}[ ]{.c6}[not very powerful, but
they should incentivize and encourage creative playing. Training perks
must be purchased at the cost of one XP each, and some players may
choose to spend XP elsewhere rather than specialize on training perks. A
character ]{.c0}[is not limited to the number of training perks they
purchase, but a player cannot obtain multiple training perks that grant
the same benefit for the same skill]{.c6}[. Each training perk should be
unique, and should be collaboratively decided between the player and the
GM, but generally speaking, training perks can do the following:]{.c2
.c0}

-   [Specialization: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[Provide advantage on skill checks
    in certain situations.]{.c2 .c0}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [Example:]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[ A character gains a perk in Melee that
    gives them advantage to attacking an enemy who is currently
    ]{.c0}[fighting]{.c6}[ with at least one other ally.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Example:]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[ A character gains a perk in
    ]{.c0}[Humanities]{.c6}[ that gives them advantage on checks dealing
    with native Mesoamerican tribes.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Example:]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[ A character gains a perk in Search that
    gives them advantage when using the skill ]{.c0}[in desert
    environments]{.c6}[.]{.c0}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [Contacts: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[Give the character beneficial contacts in
    the world. ]{.c0}[In some cases the contact can provide shelter,
    information, or other resources to benefit the character. The use of
    a contact should be limited to once per milestone, or as the story
    dictates.]{.c6}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [Example: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[A character gains a perk in Ranged that
    gives them a beneficial contact in a military or police force
    (perhaps as a shooting range instructor) that can provide aid and
    assistance to the character as the plot of the campaign dictates,
    and assuming the character is able to communicate with their
    contact. ]{.c2 .c0}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [Gear: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[Acquire gear associated with that particular
    skill, or improve gear once acquired.]{.c2 .c0}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [Example: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[A character gains a perk in the Computers
    skill and acquires a personal computer as described in the "Gear"
    section.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Example:]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[ A character gains a perk in Medicine, and
    so they improve an already-purchased medkit, ]{.c0}[and ]{.c6}[no
    longer roll DA when using the medkit to heal damage on
    the]{.c0}[mselves, as per normal]{.c6}[. (Note that in order to
    improve gear, the character must have already purchased an earlier
    perk to acquire it.)]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Expertise Perks]{.c1}

[As a character grows and becomes better in their
]{.c0}[talents]{.c6}[ they become "experts." ]{.c0}[Once a character
reaches]{.c6}[ rank 4 in a skill]{.c0}[, ]{.c6}[psionic power, or
attribute ]{.c0}[they]{.c6}[ ]{.c0}[may then purchase ]{.c6}[expertise
perks for 1XP each. ]{.c0}[However, ]{.c6}[a character can only have one
expertise perk for each rank between 4 and 6]{.c6 .c7}[. In other words,
a character with a rank of 5 in Deception could have up to 2 expertise
perks (one each for rank 4 and rank 5), but they could not have a third
expertise perk until attaining rank 6 in that skill. Of course, that
same character with a rank 5 in Deception could choose to have no
expertise perks in that skill\--they are optional just as training
perks. This also means that no skill, psionic power, or attribute may
have more than three expertise perks. ]{.c6}[Expertise perks are listed
for all skills, powers, and attributes, but ]{.c0}[other
options]{.c6}[ ]{.c0}[c]{.c6}[ould be collaboratively created between
the player and the GM if none of the listed perks suit your
character]{.c0}['s style of play]{.c6}[. ]{.c0}[Characters who choose to
retrain an expertise perk for another would still need to spend 1 XP in
order to do so.]{.c6}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[CHARACTER CREATION]{.c1}

[Since Teleios tries to emphasize story, players are encouraged to think
of "who" their character is first and foremost, rather than simply a
collection of stats (which are admittedly important!). A good way to
begin is to think of characters from popular books, movies, or other
media that appeal to players, and use that as a starting point. Another
option would be to peruse the Character Traits, Ideals, and Bonds
section (see below) for some inspiration. A final word about character
creation would be to work closely with your GM (and maybe other players
as well), since they will undoubtedly have ideas about how your
character figures into their campaign. For example, perhaps not all of
the species are available for players to play. Alternatively, maybe the
history of the campaign setting is such that it could directly tie into
a character's backstory.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Attribute Selection]{.c1}

[Aft]{.c0}[er having an idea of who their character is, a]{.c6}[ player

[AWARDING XP]{.c1}

[As a GM it can sometimes be difficult to decide when and how much XP to
award players. And while every GM is different, here are some suggested
guidelines:]{.c2 .c0}

-   [Good Role-Playing: ]{.c6 .c7}[It is advised that the GM award
    players with extra XP each per session for good role-playing. It is
    important to note that this should not be punitive in any way on
    players, but instead should reward good storytelling and
    developments that tie in to character ideals, traits, and bonds. 1
    XP (or 2 for exceptional role-playing) is a good rule of thumb.]{.c2
    .c0}
-   [Awesome Moment: ]{.c6 .c7}[Every player and GM has been in a game
    when something truly awesome happens. Maybe a character makes a
    one-in-a-million shot, or pilots their ship with verve and skill.
    Perhaps the characters collectively place themselves in such a
    funny, terrifying, or unique situation that it creates awesome
    memories. GMs are encouraged to award 1 extra XP for such moments to
    any and all players involved. ]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Milestones: ]{.c6 .c7}[When characters attain a milestone by
    advancing the plot of the story in a significant way, XP should be
    awarded commensurately, between 1-3 XP per player.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[RETRAINING]{.c1}

[Sometimes characters realize that choices they made with regards to
skills, psionic powers, ]{.c0}[CyberWare]{.c6}[, perks, and/or
attributes were poor choices, and they wish to "undo" those choices.
Such a circumstance calls for retraining. Retraining is always possible
at any time (the players should be able to modify and optimize their
characters to suit their style of play), but retraining is not without
cost. In order to retrain 1 rank in anything (skills, psionic powers,
]{.c0}[CyberWare]{.c6}[, perks, or attributes) the character must spend
1 XP, which is lost in the course of retraining; however, that character
then gains back the XP spent on the ]{.c0}[lost rank, CyberWare, or
perk]{.c6}[. The regained XP can then be spent or saved as normal. For
example, if a character has rank 3 in the psionic power Shield and
wishes to retrain it, they would first spend 1 XP to drop their rank in
Shield to 2. They would then have 2 XP (the cost of]{.c0}[ ]{.c6}[Shield
from ]{.c0}[rank 2 to 3]{.c6}[) to spend or save as normal. ]{.c0}[Bear
in mind that if a player retrains a skill, psionic power, or attribute
which would result in the loss of an expertise perk, those perks
associated with that retrained rank are also lost (but the character
would gain back the extra XP as well). ]{.c6}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[RESTING]{.c1}

[During the course of play, characters will want to (and need to) take a
break from the action in order to restore lost durability, psychovolts,
and batteries. In game terms, these characters "rest" from their
activities. In order to rest, characters need to declare that they are
resting. Doing so means that the characters spend the next six hours of
game-time sleeping, relaxing, meditating, or otherwise not performing
arduous tasks. While resting, characters can attempt to use skills and
powers to recover lost durability, batteries, and psychovolts; more
detail on recovery is provided in the following sections. Additionally,
all characters automatically restore one Luck Point when resting, not to
exceed their maximums. In some cases (GM discretion) it may not be
possible for characters to rest. For example, if the characters are
sneaking their way into a hostile organization's secret military base, a
rest in the middle of that scene would not be appropriate. Resting is
not without consequence; whenever characters rest, the GM is able to
advance the plot without the characters' interference. This may mean
(for instance) that an enemy gets closer to their goal while the
characters rested, or that an upcoming task will be more difficult for
the characters due to their dalliance. This evens the odds, since the
characters will be stronger, but so will their opposition.]{.c2 .c0}

[MILESTONES]{.c1}

[Since the Teleios game system is a story-driven system, there will come
various times when the characters will resolve certain plotlines, or
will otherwise move the direction of the story to new areas. Such
occurrences are called ]{.c6}[milestones]{.c6 .c7}[. The GM decides when
the characters have achieved a milestone. At each milestone, all lost
durability, luck, psychovolts, and batteries are restored. If characters
possess Gear which "recharges" at each milestone, then those do so.
Additionally, it is recommended that the GM award characters between 1-3
XP which aligns to the significance of the milestone. ]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c1}

[PSIONICS]{.c1}

[Psionics (PSI) is an optional attribute that can be raised from 1-6 as
can the basic attributes. Even if a starting character begins with 0
PSI, ranks can be added later by purchasing ranks in the PSI attribute
as normal. A starting character cannot have a PSI score higher than rank
4. PERS is the attribute most important for psionic characters, as it is
used to calculate psychovolts and adds to some powers; however, INT is
also a key attri]{.c0}[bute for many psionic powers. ]{.c6}[The
following rules apply to characters with a PSI score of at leas]{.c0}[t
one]{.c6}[:]{.c2 .c0}

-   [A character's PSI score = the maximum number of psionic powers that
    the character can have ranks in. For example, a character with a PSI
    of 3 can have up to three different powers available to them, but
    cannot gain a fourth power until their PSI score increases to 4. Of
    course, that same character might choose to only have 1 or 2 psionic
    powers available. Note that this means (technically) that a
    character could have a PSI score of at least one, but ]{.c0}[have no
    trained psionic powers to use\--not very optimal. Also n]{.c6}[ote
    that this means that the maximum number of psionic powers available
    to a character is 6, because a character's maximum PSI score is 6
    (although Fraal ]{.c0}[characters can have up to 7 psionic powers
    because of their free use of Telepathy)]{.c6}[. ]{.c0}[Psionic
    characters tend to specialize in certain powers at the expense of
    others. C]{.c6}[hoose wisel]{.c0}[y!]{.c6}
-   [When making a check with a psionic power, the character adds their
    ranks in the power itself along with the character's PSI score (2-12
    dice). This operates the same way ]{.c0}[as normal
    ]{.c6}[skills.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Psionic powers may]{.c0}[ not]{.c6 .c7}[ be used
    untrained]{.c0}[ under any circumstances.]{.c6}
-   [Training perks are ]{.c6}[not]{.c6 .c7}[ available for purchase for
    psionic powers, nor is there gear associated with psionic powers.
    Psionic characters may, however, purchase expertise perks at ranks
    4, 5, and 6 normally.]{.c6}
-   [Psionic powers require psychovolts to use. A character's total
    psychovolts (PV) are equal to their PERS+3. ]{.c0}[C]{.c6}[haracters
    with no PSI sc]{.c0}[ore and no ]{.c6}[psionic powers have no need
    ]{.c0}[to calculate PV.]{.c6}
-   [For every usage (]{.c0}[regardless ]{.c6}[of success degree or
    failure) of a psionic power, a character subtracts 1 psychovolt (PV)
    from their total. If 0 PV remain, the character may still attempt to
    use a power, but suffers DA on the check. In such a case, the
    psionic character also incurs 2 (ME) stun damage for every usage
    (whether success or failure) of a psionic power. This stun damage
    cannot be absorb]{.c0}[ed by any means.]{.c6}
-   [All PV are restored after the GM gives the character a
    ]{.c0}[milestone]{.c6}[. Additionally, a psionic character may use
    the Resolve skill ]{.c0}[once ]{.c6}[during a rest to restore lost
    PV. Success restores 3 PV (not to exceed the character's maximum).
    See the Resolve skill for more information.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [A psionic power that has the ]{.c0}["extend"]{.c6 .c7
    .c13}[ keyword may have its effects extended beyond the normal
    duration of the power. Upon the expiry of the power's normal
    duration, a psionic character may spend 1 additional PV to continue
    the use of that power uninterrupted for a length of time equal to
    the power's normal duration. No additional check needs to be made
    when extending a power. For example, if a character with an INT of 2
    has been using Telepathy to speak with another (for up to 5 minutes)
    and wants to continue doing so beyond those 5 minutes, they would
    simply declare that intent and spend an additional PV to continue
    the power's use for up to another 5 minutes. In cases where a
    psionic character wishes to extend a power but has no psychovolts
    remaining, they may choose to extend the power for half of the
    normal duration, ]{.c0}[and]{.c6}[ must incur 2 (ME) stun damage.
    ]{.c0}[Regardless of situation, psionic p]{.c6}[owers may only be
    extended once before the strain is too much and]{.c0}[ the psionic
    character needs to end the usage of that power]{.c6}[.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Multiple uses of psionic powers with the "extend" keyword may be in
    effect at any one time. For example, a psionic character may be
    utilizing both Cloak and Metabolism (after having paid the cost in
    psychovolts), or may be using Metabolism twice in order to increase
    both FORT and AGI separately. In such ]{.c0}[cases, the psionic
    character may choose to pay additional PV to keep the powers in
    effect after their normal duration.]{.c6}
-   [Psionic characters ]{.c6}[must]{.c6 .c7}[ choose a psionic
    detriment, listed below. A detriment may be later removed through
    the acquisition of an Expertise Perk, otherwise it remains.]{.c2
    .c0}

```{=html}

```
-   [Boost: ]{.c6 .c7}[When a character chooses this Perk, they pick
    between PERS and INT, which determines its effect listed below. (A
    character may choose this Perk a second time, selecting the other
    attribute.) Any reference to PERS or INT as a part of a psionic
    power's targeting, duration, or effects is doubled. So a character
    with a PERS score of 2 would add 4 to damage from Bolt, rather than
    2, and a character with an INT of 3 would have a base duration of 6
    hours, rather than 3, with Persuasion.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Conservationist: ]{.c6 .c7}[Three times per milestone, when the
    psionic character fails a check with a psionic power, they do not
    expend PV. Obviously the pionic character would wait until after the
    check failed before opting for this.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Extra Power: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character may learn up to seven
    psionic powers (eight for Fraal characters). Note that this is an
    extra power, not an increase to the character's PSI score.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Fast Recovery: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character may use the Resolve skill
    twice (instead of once) during rests to regain spent PV. Remember
    that every successful use of Resolve restores 3 PV not to exceed the

-   [Psi-Resistance: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character has innate ability which
    functions similarly to the Psionic Shield in the Gear description

[Any character who has a PSI score of at least 1 must choose one of the

-   [Audible:]{.c6 .c7}[ The character must speak aloud an incantation
    or other phrase in order for psionic powers to be used. The
    character's voice is audible up to 12m away. Whispering or muttering
    imposes DA on a check, but is only audible up to 3m away.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Low Psychovoltage: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[PV are equal to their PERS
    score, not PERS+3 as normal.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Slow Recovery: ]{.c6 .c7}[The character regains psychovolts slowly.
    The character only regains PV by benefit of a milestone, and does
    not regain PV by the use of the Resolve skill during a rest.]{.c2
    .c0}
-   [Talisman:]{.c6 .c7}[ The character requires an object weighing
    between 1-2 kg in order to use psionic powers. This talisman cannot
    be a simple mundane item, like a tennis shoe or an electronic
    device; it must be unique and obviously special to observers, though
    its role as a talisman is not readily evident. Examples might
    include a heavy jewel on the end of a necklace or a crystal ball.
    The talisman must be carried or worn by the character in order to
    use psionic powers normally. Additionally, the talisman cannot serve
    any other purpose (such as acting as a melee weapon or a personal
    computer). A character with this detriment who attempts to use a
    power without their talisman suffers DA. If a character's talisman
    is lost or otherwise permanently destroyed, the psionic character
    may make another via the Occult skill. Generally, the talisman
    should not be lost unless it advances the story of the game.]{.c2
    .c0}
-   [Uncontrollable Power: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[When the character fails a
    defense check (whether physical or mental), or when the character
    fails an Endurance or a Resolve check, one of their psionic powers
    activates uncontrollably for its normal duration. ]{.c0}[If the

    activates is determined randomly (or GM chooses for

[PSIONIC POWER DESCRIPTIONS]{.c1}

[Augury]{.c1}

-   [Duration:]{.c0}[ ]{.c6}[INT minutes (extend)]{.c2 .c0}

```{=html}

-   [This power enables a psionic character to read the thoughts,
    memories, emotions, and physical state of others]{.c0}[, ]{.c6}[AKA
    ]{.c0}["]{.c6}[mindreading]{.c0}[" (though psionic characters would
    describe a sentient mind as something that cannot be "read"]{.c6}[).
    A successful use of this power will reveal to the character secrets,
    memories, etc. from one target. While this power is active, the
    psionic character remains conscious, but is in a trancelike state.
    The psionic character cannot take other actions while Augury is in
    use, and the character rolls DA on any defense checks (whether
    physical or mental) while in the trance. Once per ]{.c0}[combat
    round]{.c6}[ (20 seconds) for the duration, the character may ask
    the GM a specific question about the target and the GM must answer
    truthfully. ]{.c0}[Targets of Augury immediately know that their
    mind is being probed; as such some targets may wish to close their
    mind to the psionic character. ]{.c6}[An unwilling target imposes DA
    on the character's initial check]{.c0}[, and]{.c6}[ if the Augury
    check against an unwilling target is successful, the target will
    attempt to mentally expel the user after 1 minute. In such a

    check to maintain the power for each additional minute of the
    power's duration, but would not ]{.c0}[s]{.c6}[pend PV unless the
    original duration of the power has been reached. If the psionic
    character comes into physical contact (skin-to-skin) with their
    target the check is rolled with AD. Augury can only be used on

    (FORT+PERS)xBP spent. So, if a character with a FORT of 3 and a PERS
    of 2 spent 2 batteries on recovering in this fashion, they would
    recover from being knocked out with 10 STUN. If that same character

    than most CyberWare. Instead of adding dice to a skill check,

    maximum of 4). After rolling INIT in a combat round, the cybered
    character can then choose to spend BP to gain extra actions with the
    FastChip. Spending BP in this way is completely optional, so a round
    in which a character rolls a Failure on their INIT check would not
    need to waste a BP on extra actions. Cybered characters can spend
    between 1-3 BP adding extra actions in this way, however, the effect
    of spending the BP is immediate; there is no 10-minute duration on
    the extra actions, and cybered characters]{.c6}[ cannot ]{.c6

[Hidden]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[Compartment]{.c6 .c7}

-   [A cybered character may acquire up to two
    Hidden]{.c0}[Compartment]{.c6}[s. Each HiddenCo]{.c0}[mpartment
    counts towards a character's maximum pieces of CyberWare, but each
    HiddenCompartment can be configured differently (see below). ]{.c6}
-   [Description = ]{.c6 .c7}[A HiddenCompartment is a small hollow
    cubic space inside the character which can contain many things:
    electronic devices, documents, and even small weapons. When a
    character acquires a HiddenCompartment, they should choose where the
    compartment is (for example, in the thigh or abdomen) and if it is
    intended for storage or for weaponry. A weapons compartment also
    should specify whether it is a ranged weapon that is concealed, or a
    melee weapon; HiddenCompartments are, as a rule, specifically-made
    for their user, and should be designed as such. A HiddenCompartment
    designed for storage can later be redesigned for weaponry, or vice
    versa, for the cost of 1 XP. HiddenCompartments are built directly
    into the cybered character's body, and are fully compatible with
    other CyberWare such as CyberArmor, CyberSkin, RoboArms, and
    RoboLegs.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Passive Mode = ]{.c6 .c7}[In passive mode, the HiddenCompartment is
    completely unnoticeable by others. This means that a storage
    compartment can conceal devices, documents, computer files, etc.
    that the character wants to remain hidden. No check is necessary to
    ensure the secrecy provided by the hidden compartment. Items can be
    taken in and out of the HiddenCompartment by the cybered character
    as an action. A HiddenCompartment designed to hold weapons can
    contain either a small built-in melee weapon or a small built-in
    ranged weapon and has no other purpose in passive mode, but its
    secrecy remains intact as normal.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Active Mode = ]{.c6 .c7}[The active mode for the HiddenCompartment
    applies to weapons only and has no effect for storage. A character
    with a HiddenCompartment for weapons may initiate combat with a
    surprise attack from the melee or ranged weapon in their
    HiddenCompartment. A cybered character with two HiddenCompartments
    designed for weapons can choose to gain two surprise attacks, one
    for each weapon. If a combat has already begun, the cybered
    character may choose to take a surprise round to attack with their
    weapon(s) before the next Amazing round in combat. For every BT
    spent, the cybered character rolls one extra die on their attack
    (Melee or Ranged), depending on what type of weapon they chose to
    occupy their compartment. The weapon's attack is the same as a
    normal unmodified Melee or Ranged weapon (see Gear description).
    After the surprise round, the cybered character can continue to use
    their weapon as a normal weapon for the duration of combat. Note
    that the character must spend at least one BT in order to be able to
    utilize their hidden weapon.]{.c2 .c0}

    rather than doubled.]{.c2 .c0}

    metallic bones and joints, connected through a synthetic fibrous
    muscular system. They first originated as prosthetics to assist
    individuals who lost their biological legs due to accidents or
    violence, but later became so popular that many have voluntarily
    chosen to replace their biological legs with the CyberWare version.
    RoboLegs are not noticeable, provided that the character is wearing
    clothing (pants and footwear) which obscures them. Otherwise, they
    are immediately noticeable to anyone within 30 meters.]{.c2 .c0}

[Cyber]{.c6 .c7}[Lungs]{.c1}

-   [Description = ]{.c6 .c7}[CyberLungs are somewhat inaptly named
    because they do not in fact replace a character's biological lungs,

    impurities before being inhaled.]{.c2 .c0}

    quality. The devices are designed to appear like normal eyes, with
    varieties for all species. Nonetheless, a keen observer within 10

    ones in 1 minute. Some cybered characters openly flaunt their ]{.c2

[CyberOptics by selecting iris hues of radical colors; others choose to
hide their enhancements behind regular shades, which makes detection of
CyberOptics impossible by ordinary detection methods. Note that
CyberOptics can still be detected through the use of other specialized
equipment.]{.c2 .c0}

-   [Passive Mode = ]{.c6 .c7}[In passive mode, CyberOptics allows a
    cybered character to detect wavelengths along the electromagnetic
    spectrum that are normally not visible. Characters can detect
    ultraviolet and infrared rays as well. Furthermore, CyberOptics
    provides magnification and zooming capabilities which can make
    things appear up to 20x their normal size. Coupled with the
    processing power of a NanComputer, CyberOptics are able to take and
    store photographs and videos (but the NanoComputer must be acquired
    separately). Additionally, CyberOptics expands the distance at which
    the cybered character can make an attack using the Ranged skill by
    60 meters (for a total range of 180m versus 120m for non-cybered
    characters).]{.c2 .c0}

    instance). ]{.c2 .c0}

    color. It is important to note that CyberSkin does not alter
    physical structural features; for instance, activating CyberSkin
    would not allow a character to adjust the size of their nose. For
    every BT spent, the cybered character adds one extra die to checks

[CHARACTER ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[IDEALS, TRAITS, & BONDS]{.c6 .c7}

[The Teleios system is primarily a storytelling system, and players and
GMs should keep in mind that good storytelling and good roleplaying are
what make any tabletop game enjoyable. The following section is designed
to help players and GMs "flesh out" their characters and NPCs. Ideals,
traits, and bonds]{.c6}[ are roleplaying items that try to make an
actual "character" out of the character, rather than just a bunch of
numbers.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Ideals]{.c1}

[A character should begin play with at least one but no more than two
ideals. Ideals can be thought of as "goals;" what are the character's
overriding goals? What motivates the character? What drives them to do
what they do? A character's goals may change over the course of a
campaign (and in such a case, the player should work with the GM to
discuss the character's new ideals), but it establishes an overview of
what the character wants. The sample ideal list below is by no means
exhaustive, but it can be a starting point for players to choose their
character's ideals.]{.c2 .c0}

-   [Evangelization: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character is driven to spread a
    message or an idea to others, preferably as many others as possible.
    Perhaps the character is a religious zealot, or a political
    revolutionary. In any case, they seek converts to their
    worldview.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Fun: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character's overriding goal is to experience
    pleasure in all of its varied forms. Everything this character does
    is designed to perpetuate their luxurious lifestyle, and to live
    their life to the fullest. ]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Love: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character puts the person(s) they love before
    everything, and the well-being of those loved ones comes before all
    else, even the character's own well-being. This ideal suits
    characters who have romance, family (parents, siblings, or
    children), or who wish to reconcile with a loved one as a part of
    their character's background.]{.c6}
-   [More: ]{.c6 .c7}[A character with this ideal wants to acquire as
    much wealth and as many material possessions as they can. They want
    it all, and they are reluctant to share with the rest of the world.
    Perhaps this character is motivated to possess a certain object, or
    to collect only certain objects. Most importantly, why is the
    character driven by material wealth?]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Knowledge: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character is driven by the quest to
    discover. Perhaps the character is concerned with cosmic questions
    of good and evil, or with achieving a particular scientific or
    technological breakthrough. In any case, this character believes
    that by discovering the truth, they can ultimately better society,
    or can conversely use that knowledge to their exclusive
    advantage.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Power: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character craves clout. They have a lust for
    all the benefits and privileges that go with command, and the rest
    of the trappings of power. This character could be motivated by
    military rank, political influence, or technological power.]{.c2
    .c0}
-   [Survival: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character wants desperately to live, but
    there are forces at work which seek to destroy the character. This
    character may be a fugitive, a radical visionary, the last of a
    family or other group, or someone that can be exploited by others.
    They put their own survival ahead of other concerns.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Truth: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character is suspicious of the world in some
    way, and seeks to uncover the truth. Perhaps the character was the
    victim of a smear campaign, or has knowledge that a government or
    corporation has knowingly lied to the public. By seeking to uncover
    and publicize the truth, this character feels they can rectify some
    past wrong.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Vengeance: ]{.c6 .c7}[Someone (or something) committed a heinous
    wrong against this character in the past, and now the character is
    on a quest of revenge to right that wrong, no matter the costs.]{.c2
    .c0}
-   [Winning: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character seeks to be the very best at
    what they do. They seek to become the best scientist, soldier,
    athlete, artist, etc. in the world, and they are constantly testing
    their abilities in order to achieve perfection. The intrinsic
    motivation to excel is all that matters.]{.c6}

[]{.c1}

[Traits]{.c1}

[A character should begin play with at least one, but no more than three
traits. A trait is a general personality characteristic that is used for
roleplaying purposes. They may be good or bad (or both),
]{.c0}[and]{.c6}[ they ]{.c0}[determine (to a degree) how the character
interacts with the world. ]{.c6}[Tra]{.c0}[its do not convey in-game
bonuses, but they can be used to guide players in the usage of certain
skills, or in mannerisms that can be used to emphasize the uniqueness of
their characters.]{.c6}[ It is recommended that the GM award one XP per
rest to players who engage in good roleplaying via their traits. The
sample trait list ]{.c0}[below is by no means exhaustive, but it can be
a starting point for players to choose their character's traits.]{.c6}

-   [Admirer: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character admires and/idolizes someone.
    Their idol could perhaps be a family member, historical figure,
    religious figure, or celebrity, etc. The character constantly seeks
    to imitate their idol's behavior, and frequently brings up their
    idol in conversation, whether applicable or not.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Aggressive: ]{.c6 .c7}["Might makes right" is this character's
    motto. Aggressive characters are unafraid to assert themselves
    intimidatingly or in  a hostile fashion into situations.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Amicable: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character is easygoing and makes friends
    easily, regardless of sex, gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, etc.
    They know enough ice-breakers to make even the most obstinate
    adversary warm to them.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Apathetic: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character finds it very difficult to
    really care about anything. Maybe they believe that nothing matters
    in the end, or maybe they lack the knowledge to form opinions.
    Apathetic characters may be aloof, indifferent, or even cynical at
    times.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Brave: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character is unafraid to stand their ground,
    even against insurmountable odds, regardless of the situation or
    consequences. Brave characters believe that their power exists to
    help those who are less fortunate, and that heroes are needed. They
    often emulate romantic ideas of medieval knights, swashbucklers, or
    Wild West lawmen.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Calm: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character remains calm in almost every
    situation, and rarely raises their voice or succumbs to emotions,
    even in world-shattering cases. They have an even-keeled perception
    of the world.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Careless: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character has a penchant for breaking
    things and for getting into accidents. For some reason they find it
    difficult keeping their hands to themselves, and will trip or
    stumble at the slightest impediment.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Celebrity: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character is well-known in certain
    circles (art, music, craftsmanship, politics, etc.). They can
    capitalize on their fame in many cases, but they are easily offended
    when they encounter someone who does not know of or appreciate their
    fame.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Charmer:]{.c6 .c7}[ This character has perfected the art of
    "kissing ass," or "brownnosing" to get what they want. They are
    always spewing flattering statements and compliments, especially
    when they can gain or benefit by doing so.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Confident: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character has a good sense of their
    abilities and shortcomings, and they also try to encourage others to
    be more confident in their abilities.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Conformist: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character is a "team player." A
    conformist character does not like to "stick out," and will do
    almost anything to blend in (clothing, politics, customs, etc.).
    They do not speak up or cause trouble, but simply "go with the
    flow."]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Corrupt: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character lives by a moral code which
    emphasizes their personal gain above all other considerations. A
    corrupt character may still engage in noble or worthy acts as long
    as it advances their agenda.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Cowardly: ]{.c6 .c7}[A cowardly character displays fear in the face
    of adversity, and will flee or avoid danger in most cases.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Defiant: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character has a tendency to defy
    authority. They sometimes choose not to see the true situation due
    to their defiance, and often run afoul of legal or political
    authorities.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Despicable: ]{.c6 .c7}[A despicable character has no moral compass
    whatsoever; they are twisted, evil, or possibly insane. Their
    behaviors may be erratic, or may be cool and calculating. They enjoy
    seeing others in pain and hold no regard for any authority other
    than their own.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Determined: ]{.c6 .c7}[When this character sets their mind to
    something, virtually nothing is capable of standing in their way to
    accomplish said goal.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Doer: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character tends to be introverted and quiet,
    choosing instead to make their mind known by their deeds. They tend
    to judge others in the same way, by actions rather than
    speeches.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Ear-To-The-Ground: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character has a keen tendency to
    gather rumors and gossip wherever they go. ]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Egalitarian: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character truly sees others as their
    equal, regardless of sex, gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality,

-   [Fatalist: ]{.c6 .c7}[To this character, everything happens for a
    reason, and they are disinclined to intervene in what they see as
    events taking their preordained course.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Generous: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character is giving of their money, time,
    and talents to the point where they can sometimes become
    impoverished.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Hateful: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character possesses a deep-seeded hatred
    against a person, group, place, thing, or organization. They never
    fail to remind others of their animosity.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Hedonist: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character indulges to excess the "bad"
    things in life: alcohol, drugs, gambling, and/or sex. In many cases
    the character is addicted to a certain stimulus, and finds it
    difficult to operate without it for long.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Helpful: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character's nature is to assist others in
    times of need. Perhaps they are driven by an ethical or moral code,
    but a helpful character strives to do good.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Honest: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character says exactly what they are
    thinking, often to the chagrin of others. In some cases, they are
    intuitive of others' emotions and speak aloud what others are

    doing so.]{.c2 .c0}

-   [Intolerant: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character subscribes to a narrow

    mind to other points of view. They are quick to judge others who
    stray from their definition of the norm.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Inquisitive: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character always seeks to know how
    things work, and what motivates others. They seek answers to even

    them, the constant question is "why?"]{.c2 .c0}

[Bonds]{.c1}

[A bond is a deep connection that a character feels towards a person,
group, place, or thing. Bonds may be positive in nature]{.c0}[ (i.e. the
character is deeply grateful to their former military unit for their
comradeship in combat) or negative (i.e. the character owes a
significant debt to a criminal organization). In all cases, bonds
establish a character's relationship with the rest of the world.
]{.c6}[It is recommended that characters begin play with one strong
bond, and perhaps one or two weaker bonds. These help establish a
character's backstory, and ground the character in the world. They may
also be used as plot devices by the GM.]{.c0}

[SKILL DESCRIPTIONS (]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[BY NAME)]{.c1}

[Acrobatics -- AGI]{.c1}

-   [This is the "default" AGI check, and in cases where the GM decides
    on such a check, Acrobatics will be rolled.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Acrobatics is utilized whenever a character attempts to engage in a
    physical activity that requires a great deal of coordination,
    balance, dexterity, and/or gymnastic talent. Examples would include
    walking a tightrope between two buildings, hovering in
    zero-gravity]{.c0}[, ]{.c6}[tumbling out of the way in a firefight,
    or trying not to slip on an icy surface. A successful roll means
    that the character accomplishes their acrobatic feat (for the time
    being).]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Expertise Perks:]{.c1}

```{=html}

```
-   [Missed Me: ]{.c6 .c7}[Once per milestone, a character with this
    perk may ignore all damage received from a single attack that
    targeted physical defense. This can be invoked after making the
    defense check and calculating damage.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c1}

[Animals -- PERS]{.c1}

-   [The Animals skill is used when a character is interacting with
    animals of any type, wild or domestic. Note that this is a skill
    that is based on PERS, not on INT. The Animals skill is used in
    cases where a character is trying to ride, handle, befriend (or not
    be eaten by) an animal, or when a character is attempting to train
    an intelligent, domesticated animal to perform certain tasks.
    Factual information on the animals (i.e. their diets, habitats,
    etc.) are academic knowledge, and therefore would be best rolled by
    using the Outdoors skill using INT as the attribute (see Outdoors
    for more information).]{.c2 .c0}

[Athletics -- FORT]{.c1}

-   [This is the "default" FORT check, and in cases where the GM decides
    on such a check, Athletics will be rolled.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [An Athletics check is rolled when the character attempts to use
    strength or speed to accomplish a task. Examples would include
    climbing a ledge, sprinting down an alley, or lifting a heavy
    object. A successful check means that the character has succeeded in
    their athletic feat (for the time being). ]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Expertise Perks:]{.c6 .c7 .c13}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Bureaucracy -- INT]{.c1}

-   [Bureaucracy is a knowledge skill that reflects a character's
    knowledge of various bureaucratic systems such as governments, legal
    systems, corporations, organized religions, or other similar
    hierarchies. Successful use of Bureaucracy means that a character
    has gained, or is able to recall, key details about the bureaucratic
    systems in place in a certain situation. These key details may even
    translate as bonuses on other related skill checks in the form of
    providing advantage.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Gear -- Fashion Suit: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[The fashion suit is an
    assemblage of clothing, shoes, accessories, etc. that emit an aura
    of confidence and belonging. The suit can also superficially change
    colors, emit pleasing (or unpleasing odors), and can enable a
    character to "fit in" in certain locales. The Fashion Suit grants
    advantage on Bureaucracy, Charm, Deception, and Streetwise checks in
    situations where personal dress and physical appearance may play a
    role. The player must declare their intent to modify their Fashion
    Suit before such an event. ]{.c6}[This is the same Fashion Suit as

-   [Resourceful Contacts: ]{.c6 .c7}[This character has developed a
    contact that is exceptionally beneficial. Rather than gaining
    information, assistance, or resources from this contact once per
    milestone as is usual, this character is able to utilize their
    contact twice per milestone. This Perk may be taken multiple times,
    once for each contact a character has.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Charm -- PERS]{.c1}

-   [A Charm check is made when a character attempts to gain information
    or assistance from an NPC. A successful roll means that the NPC is
    willing to assist and aid the character (within reason) until the
    situation changes, at which point the character may need to re-roll
    the Charm check (depending on circumstances). A character may
    attempt to use Charm against multiple targets (up to their PERS
    score) using the same action, but each check needs to be rolled
    separately.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Gear -- Fashion Suit: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[The fashion suit is an
    assemblage of clothing, shoes, accessories, etc. that emit an aura

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Computers -- INT]{.c1}

-   [The Computers skill represents a character's ability to use
    computerized systems to their fullest effect. It is assumed that all
    characters have a basic understanding of computer technology, as it
    is ubiquitous in the world; however, characters who use Computers
    are able to make even ordinary devices perform above what the
    untrained can do. For instance, while every character would be able
    to use basic functions on a computer (search, save, delete,
    communicate, etc.), by using Computers a character is able to hack
    into a computer system, or to re-write computer code to their
    liking.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Gear -- Personal Computer: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[A character trained in
    Computers has a small personal ]{.c0}[computer]{.c6}[ that has
    capabilities not found in other normal devices. Most notably, a
    ]{.c0}[personal computer]{.c6}[ can be used to hack into other
    computer or electronic systems wirelessly to a range of 30m. A
    character's de]{.c0}[vice]{.c6}[ can vary to suit the player, but
    ]{.c0}[they]{.c6}[ are generally small, thin, hand-held
    ]{.c0}[machine]{.c6}[s. A wireless hack imposes DA to the Computers
    check, but if the character physically connects their
    ]{.c0}[device]{.c6}[ to a computer or electronic lock being hacked
    via wires, the roll is done as normal. ]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Expertise Perks:]{.c6 .c7 .c13}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Deception -- PERS]{.c1}

-   [When a character chooses to knowingly lie or deceiv]{.c0}[e]{.c6}[,
    a Deception check is made. A successful roll means that the target
    believes the character's lie until there is a change in the
    situation, at which point the character may need to re-roll the
    Deception check (depending on circumstances). A character may
    attempt to use Deception against multiple targets (up to their PERS
    score) using the same action, but each check needs to be rolled
    separately. It is imp]{.c0}[ortant to note that if and when an NPC
    discovers that they have been lied to, their attitude towards the
    character will probably lessen, making further interactions more
    difficult.]{.c6}
-   [Gear -- Fashion Suit: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[The fashion suit is an
    assemblage of clothing, shoes, accessories, etc. that emit an aura
    of confidence and belonging. The suit can also superficially change
    colors, emit pleasing (or unpleasing odors), and can enable a
    character to "fit in" in certain locales. The Fashion Suit grants
    advantage on Bureaucracy, Charm, Deception, and Streetwise checks in
    situations where personal dress and physical appearance may play a

[Deduce -- INT]{.c1}

-   [This is the "default" INT check, and in cases where the GM decides
    on such a check, Deduce will be rolled. ]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Deduce is a measure of a character]{.c0}['s innate ability to see
    patterns in information, and to fit those patterns together into a
    pleasing whole. Solving puzzles and "connecting the dots," so to
    speak, are when Deduce checks would be necessary.]{.c6}

    languages. This perk may be taken twice.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Endurance -- FORT]{.c1}

-   [The Endurance skill represents a character's physical stamina and
    toughness. Endurance checks are made in cases where a character is
    trying to resist adverse environments, such as extreme cold or heat,
    or when a character is fighting off disease or infection. Endurance
    checks can also be made to determine whether or not a character is
    able to continue with physically strenuous work, such as running a
    marathon. A success on an Endurance check generally means that the
    character is unaffected by the challenge and may continue to take
    actions as normal until the GM decides otherwise. A failure
    generally means that the character succumbs to the physical
    challenge, and suffers the consequences as dictated by the
    situation. Finally, a character may make an Endurance check during a
    rest to restore 1 point of body durability.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Gear -- Armor: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[A character trained in Endurance has
    body armor that protects against physical damage. Armor soaks 1d6
    LI/1d3 HI/1d6 EN damage. It has no soaking ability versus ME damage.
    The body armor is akin to a bulletproof vest in its general mass and
    bulkiness. It can be concealed at range by clothing, but any
    observers within 6 meters of the character can identify the armor
    within 1 minute. A character wearing armor has DA to Acrobatics,
    Athletics, Stealth, and Thievery checks. ]{.c0}[Tesa characters have
    a natural "Armor" due to their scales which does not impose
    penalties on the aforementioned skill checks.]{.c6}
-   [Gear --]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[ ]{.c0}[E-Suit: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[The E-Suit
    (short for "environment suit") better enables the character to
    withstand environmental extremes (heat, cold, low oxygen, etc.). The
    E-Suit is sort of a combination between a hazmat suit, a scuba suit,
    and a lightweight spacesuit. E-Suits are not normal fashion, so it's
    obvious that a character is wearing one (though the appearance could
    be improved by spending further XP). The first time the GM calls for
    an Endurance check to resist the environment, a character with an
    E-Suit rolls their check with advantage. Any level of success allows
    the character to continue rolling with advantage thereafter. Any
    failure results mean that the suit is incapable of handling the
    extremes and ceases to function until the character takes a rest, or
    until the GM awards a milestone. The E-Suit is also equipped with a
    respirator that can be used in space or underwater, or to mitigate
    the effects of smoke or toxins, for 10 minutes per milestone.

[H]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[umanities]{.c6 .c7}[ -- INT]{.c1}

-   [Humanities is a knowledge skill that reflects a character's
    familiarity with the past, historical events, patterns of human
    behavior, art, literature, music, and other liberal studies in
    general. A successful Humanities check means the character has
    successfully recalled or applied knowledge about the past, human
    societies, artwork, mythology, literature, theatre, or other
    questions of psychology and economics. This success could even be
    translated into advantage on future related checks.]{.c2 .c0}

[Medicine -- INT]{.c1}

-   [Medicine is a skill that reflects a character's knowledge of human
    (and potentially animal) physiology. The character may be adept at
    diagnosing medical problems, and may potentially have first aid
    training, or be able to treat disease or illness. A successful use
    of Medicine is generally used outside of combat, and means that the
    character has succeeded (at least temporarily) in their efforts to
    diagnose or treat themselves or others. During a rest, a character
    can use Medicine once to restore either 1d3 body durability in
    themselves or another individual. ]{.c2 .c0}

[Melee -- FORT]{.c1}

-   [Melee represents a character's ability to use their body (hands,
    fists, etc.) in order to inflict damage, or to otherwise restrain or
    incapacitate others. When trying to harm another, a successful use
    inflicts 1d3+FORT (LI) body damage, or 1d6+FORT (LI) stun damage.
    The player chooses which durability type to target before making the
    Melee check. When trying to disarm, restrain, or otherwise use their
    body without the direct intent to inflict harm, success means that
    the character succeeds in the attempted action (at least for a

    can use Ranged to throw a small-to-medium-sized object (such as a
    stone) up to FORTx6 meters (see "Standard Physical Abilities"
    below). This object could then feasibly cause damage equal to
    1d3 (LI) body damage or 1d6 (LI) stun damage, provided that it is a
    hard or otherwise damaging object (throwing a soft pillow would not
    cause this damage). Allowances should be made for objects designed

    personal computer).]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Gear -- Ranged Weapon:]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[ A character trained in
    Ranged has a ranged weapon that can be used as an action in combat.
    The ranged weapon deals 2d6 (HI) body damage on a successful check

    of the character (provided there are no obstructions), and require
    two hands to use. The ranged weapon is obvious to onlookers and
    cannot be hidden. Ranged weapons create noise when used, and
    listeners within 360m of the character are able to hear it

    on such a check, Resolve will be rolled.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [The Resolve skill is used in cases where a character's mental or
    spiritual capacity is stretched to the limit. For example, the GM
    may call for a Resolve check in order to withstand intense terror,
    grotesqueness, or shock. A success on such a check means that the
    character can act as normal in those situations. Resolve is also
    important for psionic characters. Once per rest, a psionic character
    may make a Resolve check to restore 3 spent psychovolts. Resolve
    cannot be used to restore psychovolts beyond their maximum, however.

    check for each NPC. A character who is successfully hidden may break
    cover to initiate a surprise round in combat. In such a case, the

    important skill for being able to repair technological devices. A
    successful skill check to repair (which requires a rest) results in
    the desired piece of equipment becoming functional again.
    Alternatively, a character may use Technology to "jury-rig" a broken
    device. Jury-rigging requires two combat actions, and results in the
    desired device becoming functional for another 1d6 hours, after
    which the device breaks again and cannot be used until repaired as
    normal during a rest. Using Repair to fix damaged CyberWare imposes
    DA on the skill check. Additionally, Technology is also important

[Damage Types]{.c1}

[In the course of a campaign it is likely that characters take damage.
There are four damage types:]{.c2 .c0}

-   [Low-Impact (LI) Damage: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[This is damage caused by
    things such as melee attacks and other
    ]{.c0}[subsonic]{.c6}[ projectiles. Armor is generally effective at
    blocking this type of damage.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [High-Impact (HI) Damage:]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[ This is damage caused by
    high-velocity projectiles, such as ranged weapon attacks and
    explosions. Armor is less-effective at blocking HI damage, but it is
    better than nothing.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Energy (EN) Damage: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[This is damage caused by varied
    forms of energy, like fire, electricity, extreme cold,
    psion]{.c0}[ic energy, ]{.c6}[etc. Armor is generally effective at
    blocking this damage, but ce]{.c0}[rtain types of energy may be more
    or less harmful to your character, depending on different
    situations]{.c6}[.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Mental (ME) Damage: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[This is damage caused by some
    psionic powers and mental strain as dictated by the GM. No type of
    armor or shield can block ME damage.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c1}

[Armor and Soaking Damage]{.c1}

[Characters who wear Armor, or who have other means of protection, can
absorb some or all of the damage they receive. The Armor provided in the
Gear section has a rating of 1d6 LI/1d3 HI/1d6 EN, meaning that if the
character would receive low-impact (LI) damage, they would first roll
1d6 to see how much of that damage would be soaked by their armor. Any
remaining damage would be incurred to the character as normal. Note that
soaking damage using armor has no effect on secondary damage (see
below), nor does Armor protect against mental (ME) damage. A character
can generally only benefit from Armor once, although some rare
circumstances may allow multiple ways to absorb harm.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c1}

[Secondary Damage]{.c1}

[When a character incurs BODY damage, they may also incur some STUN
damage by the sheer impact of the damage; this is known as secondary
damage. For every 3 points of BODY damage that a character takes from a
single source, they also take 1 additional point of STUN damage
secondarily. This secondary damage follows the normal rules of rounding
in the characters' favors, so an attack that deals 5 BODY damage would
only deal 1 additional STUN damage. Armor is not effective at absorbing
secondary damage.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Knockouts]{.c1}

[As mentioned above, a character is knocked unconscious when their STUN
durability rating drops to zero. A character who is knocked out cannot
take any actions, and any attacks targeted against them automatically
succeed. A character remains unconscious for 6 combat phases (30
seconds) beginning the phase immediately after the knockout, after which
the character can begin making Endurance checks in order to regain
consciousness. A character who regains consciousness in this fashion
also regains STUN durability equal to their FORT+PERS. Unconscious
characters who continue to receive physical damage (low-impact,
high-impact, or energy) incur all damage to their remaining BODY
durability. (Since mental damage only affects STUN, an unconscious
character does not suffer mental damage.)]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Early Knockouts]{.c1}

[Some attacks are so powerful that, in addition to causing secondary
damage, they run the risk of knocking characters out, even if their STUN
durability is well above zero. If a character ever incurs damage equal
to or greater than one-third of their total ]{.c6}[remaining
durability]{.c6 .c7}[, they run the risk of an early knockout. In such a
case, after taking the requisite damage, the character in question would
either roll an Endurance check (for BODY damage) or a Resolve check (for
STUN damage). Any success on those checks means that the character
remains conscious. A Failure would result in the character losing their
remaining STUN durability points and falling unconscious (see
"Knockouts" above).]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[GEAR AND MONEY]{.c1}

[In a modern-to-far future game, technology and gear are parts of
everyday life. However, the Teleios game is designed as a storytelling
game, and as such does not contain detailed rules for encumbrance, etc.
All characters are assumed to have personal effects such as clothing,
keys, a communication device, a wallet/bankchip, etc. Above and beyond
those base essentials, it is assumed that characters have a residence of
some type, and some means of employment. In other words, it is
encouraged for GMs to not spend any time tracking how characters pay for
each meal (assume that they have food to eat unless the story dictates
otherwise), and spend more time focusing on the plot and story of the
adventure. Any Gear that characters acquire and/or improve costs XP, so
GMs should generally allow players to deck their characters out with
whatever items they choose (they've paid for it, after all). It should
also be rare for a player to NOT have access to an item of Gear for
which they have paid XP; generally only a good story reason should
restrict a character's access to their items (theft of a unique weapon,
damage to a character's vehicle in a close firefight, etc.). Of course,
such story reasons can be launch points for great adventures (how to
recover said weapon, or how to repair the damaged vehicle).]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c1}

[GEAR DESCRIPTIONS]{.c6 .c7 .c13}

[Armor - Endurance]{.c1}

[A character trained in Endurance has body armor that protects against
physical damage. Armor soaks 1d6 LI/1d3 HI/1d6 EN damage. It has no
soaking ability versus ME damage. The body armor is akin to a
bulletproof vest in its general mass and bulkiness. It can be concealed
at range by clothing, but any observers within 6 meters of the character
can identify the armor within 1 minute. A character wearing armor has DA
to Acrobatics, Athletics, Stealth, and Thievery checks. Tesa characters
have a natural "Armor" due to their scales which does not impose
penalties on the aforementioned skill checks.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[E-Suit - Endurance, Outdoors ]{.c1}

[The E-Suit (short for "environment suit") better enables the character
to withstand environmental extremes (heat, cold, low oxygen, etc.). The
E-Suit is sort of a combination between a hazmat suit, a scuba suit, and
a lightweight spacesuit. E-Suits are not normal fashion, so it's obvious
that a character is wearing one (though the appearance could be improved
by spending further XP). The first time the GM calls for an Endurance
check to resist the environment, a character with an E-Suit rolls their
check with advantage. Any level of success allows the character to
continue rolling with advantage thereafter. Any failure results mean
that the suit is incapable of handling the extremes and ceases to
function until the character takes a rest, or until the GM awards a
milestone. The E-Suit is also equipped with a respirator that can be
used in space or underwater, or to mitigate the effects of smoke or
toxins, for 10 minutes per milestone. ]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Explosives Kit - Tactics]{.c1}

[The explosives kit comes in two separate forms: as a satchel charge or
as three small grenades. The character who acquires an explosives kit
must specify which kit they choose. Each kit may be "recharged," so to
speak, once per milestone. At each milestone a character may "swap" a
satchel charge for three grenades, or vice versa. The satchel charge may
be used as part of a Tactics check to destroy a large vehicle or small
building. Each grenade may be used as a thrown weapon (see the Ranged
skill) which deals 2d6 (HI) body damage for a fragmentation grenade or
3d6 (LI) stun damage for a concussion grenade. The player must choose
which damage to deal before making the Ranged check. Other types of
grenades may be available by spending XP to improve the gear. The
satchel charge is the general size and mass of a briefcase and can be
easily disguised as such from the outside. The three grenades are the
size and mass of baseballs and can be easily concealed by clothing.]{.c2
.c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Fashion Suit - Bureaucracy, Charm, Deception, Streetwise]{.c1}

[The fashion suit is an assemblage of clothing, shoes, accessories, etc.
that emit an aura of confidence and belonging. The suit can also
superficially change colors, emit pleasing (or unpleasing odors), and
can enable a character to "fit in" in certain locales. The Fashion Suit
grants advantage on Bureaucracy, Charm, Deception, and Streetwise checks
in situations where personal dress and physical appearance may play a
role. The player must declare their intent to modify their Fashion Suit
before such an event. ]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Forensics Kit - Science, Search]{.c1}

[The forensics kit includes inks, dyes, powders, and other tools useful
to investigators of all types, including police, detectives, and other
operatives. The forensics kit is roughly the size and shape of a book,
and grants a character AD on Search checks when used to find minute
details in a scene, and can also provide much more detailed information
than would otherwise be possible (for example, that the crime was
committed by a male with black hair, rather than simply a crime was
committed by a person standing 1.8 meters tall). Using the forensics kit
requires 30 minutes, and so cannot be used in a combat scene. ]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Lockpick Set - Thievery]{.c1}

[The lockpick set consists of physical and electronic devices which
facilitate lockpicking and illicit entry. The lockpick set itself is
roughly the size and shape of a small book. Use of the lockpick set
grants AD to lockpicking physical locks, and negates the DA imposed on
electronic locks. ]{.c6}

[]{.c1}

[Medical Kit - Medicine]{.c1}

[A character trained in Medicine has a small medical kit ("medkit" for
short) that can be used to restore damage in themselves or in others in
and out of combat scenarios. The medkit is roughly the size and shape of
a book, and contains an assortment of pharmaceuticals, bandages,
surgical tools, etc. There are enough supplies in each medkit to be used
up to three times per milestone, and upon reaching a milestone, the
medkit is "recharged." The medkit can be used in a combat scene with a
Medicine check to restore up to 2d6 stun damage to an individual. Doing
so in combat requires 2 actions (for a minimum of 2 combat phases).
During a rest, the medkit can be used to restore up to 1d6 body damage.
Note that this is in addition to any durability gained by characters
through the Endurance skill. If a character tries to use a medkit on
themselves, they suffer DA to the Medicine check.]{.c6}[ ]{.c1}

[]{.c1}

[Melee Weapon - Melee]{.c1}

[A character trained in Melee has a melee weapon that can be used as an
action in combat. The melee weapon deals 1d6+FORT (LI) body damage, or
2d6+FORT (LI) stun damage. The character chooses which damage type to
deal when using the weapon and before making the Melee check. The exact
weapon the character uses can vary from player to player, but melee
weapons are able to be used one-handed. They are capable of striking an
enemy that the character is adjacent to (within 1 meter). The melee
weapon is obvious to onlookers and cannot be successfully hidden. Melee
weapons do not produce noise at great distances.]{.c6}

[]{.c1}

[Personal Computer - Computers ]{.c1}

[A character trained in Computers has a small personal computer that has
capabilities not found in other normal devices. Most notably, a personal
computer can be used to hack into other computer or electronic systems
wirelessly to a range of 30m. A character's device can vary to suit the
player, but they are generally small, thin, hand-held machines. A
wireless hack imposes DA to the Computers check, but if the character
physically connects their device to a computer or electronic lock being
hacked via wires, the roll is done as normal. ]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Personal Vehicle - Vehicles]{.c1}

[The character is in possession of a small, one-person capacity personal
vehicle. This vehicle is generally designed for land usage, but can be
modified to travel in the air, the water, or in space for extra XP. The
personal vehicle provides very little in the way of physical protection
(think of a motorcycle), but can enable the character to travel
independently at need.]{.c6}

[]{.c1}

[Psionic Detector - Occult, Science]{.c1}

[The psionic detector is a small device that looks similar to a normal
personal computer or communication device. If any psionic power is used
(or is in use) within 30 meters, the detector will alert and will
pinpoint the general direction of the usage. Note that this includes any
active psionic powers from the character themselves, or any allies. If
the character is actively monitoring the detector, any usage of a
psionic power will pinpoint the individual who used the power. The
carrying character may voluntarily choose to "switch off" the detector
and remain ignorant to psionic activity in their
surroundings.]{.c6}[ ]{.c6 .c7}[A character may choose to combine their
Psionic Detector into one device along with their personal communicator
or other devices (provided that they have paid 1 XP each to get each
Gear item). ]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Psionic Shield - Occult]{.c1}

[The psionic shield is a small device that looks similar to a normal
personal computer or communication device. It may be used in one of two
ways; first, if worn or carried by a character, it either imposes DA on
any psionic power used within 30 meters (for characters) or grants the
carrying character AD on defense checks to resist psionic attacks (for
NPCs). The carrying character may voluntarily choose to "switch off" the
shield and ignore these penalties and advantages. Alternatively, the
psionic shield may be "clamped" onto an individual (restraints and
modifications may be made to fit around an individual's neck). In such a
case the individual to whom it is attached may not use psionic powers
while the device is active.]{.c6}[ ]{.c6 .c7}[A character may choose to
combine their Psionic Shield into one device along with their personal
communicator or other devices (provided that they have paid 1 XP each to
get each Gear item).]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Ranged Weapon - Ranged]{.c1}

[A character trained in Ranged has a ranged weapon that can be used as
an action in combat. The ranged weapon deals 2d6 (HI) body damage on a
successful check result. Ranged weapons may target anything within 120m
of the character (provided there are no obstructions), and require two
hands to use. The ranged weapon is obvious to onlookers and cannot be
hidden. Ranged weapons create noise when used, and listeners within 360m
of the character are able to hear it clearly.]{.c6}

[]{.c1}

[Repair Kit - Technology]{.c1}

[The repair kit includes tools and electronics which are useful in
fixing damaged technological or electronic devices. The kit itself is
about the size and shape of a book. Using the repair kit outside of
combat reduces the time to fix items to 1 hour, rather than 1d6 hours.
When using the Repair Kit to jury-rig, it provides AD on the related
Technology check. ]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Science Kit - Science]{.c1}

[A character trained in Science has a small science kit that enables
them to conduct scientific lab work and fieldwork when an actual lab is
not present. The science kit is roughly the size and shape of a
briefcase, and contains vials, test tubes, chemical bases and solvents,
etc. Using a science kit grants a character AD on Science checks when a
physical sample is available to study (mineral, tissue, etc.). The use
of a science kit in this way takes 30 minutes, and so is not available
during a combat encounter.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Sensor Array - Science, Search, Technology]{.c1}

[The sensor array is an electronic device that detects a large quantity
of environmental data, such as temperature, humidity, UV radiation,
electromagnetic radiation, infrared, etc. The sensor array itself is a
device similar to a regular computer or communication device carried by
most people. Using the sensor array outside of a combat scene (which
requires 3 minutes) grants the character a wealth of knowledge about
their immediate environment, up to 120 meters away. It can also provide
AD on the Search skill when used to detect larger-scale environmental
features in a scene.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Stealth Unit - Stealth]{.c1}

[The stealth unit is a small electronic device in similar size and shape
to a regular computer or communication device carried by most people.
The stealth device includes sound-dampening technology and projects
image-blurring which grants a character with this device AD on Stealth
checks. If a character using a stealth unit remains quiet and
motionless, they cannot be detected. Any motion or noise would trigger
another Stealth check, but with AD. The character can choose to turn
this device on and off.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Survival Kit - Outdoors]{.c1}

[The survival kit is a small briefcase-sized kit which contains
emergency supplies that are useful in the wilderness. It contains a
variety of dried foodstuffs, water purification tablets, emergency
blankets, lamps, heaters, and navigational tools. A character who makes
an Outdoors check while in possession of a survival kit (depending on
situation) will receive AD on the check.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[STANDARD PHYSICAL ABILITIES]{.c1}

[The standards listed below are the maximum values in each category for
each character. CyberWare adds to these standard abilities (see
CyberWare for more information). Any attempts to perform physical feats
within these parameters may necessitate an Athletics, Acrobatics, or
Endurance check (GM discretion), and even so, may not be possible.]{.c2
.c0}

[]{.c1}

-   [Standing Jump: ]{.c6 .c7 .c13}[A standing jump measures the
    horizontal distance a character can leap from a standstill position.
    A character may make a second action in a combat phase while making
    a standing jump, but the second action suffers DA.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [(FORT+AGI)/4 meters max distance]{.c1}

[Android]{.c1}

[Androids are a species of humanoid whose synthesis of nanotechnology
and biological tissue is so complete as to be inseparable and virtually
indistinguishable from each other. Native to the planet Aleer, Android
history tells of a time when their species had no advanced technology,
and they called themselves simply the "Aleer." Since those now-forgotten
days, however, Aleer scientists, geneticists, and technicians were able
to advance nanotechnology to the point where the entire species now has
synthetic elements blended into their tissues. (Note that the term
"Android" was given to this species by Humans and is now a widely
accepted parlance, but that among their own kind the Aleer prefer the
term "Aleer.") From a distance it can be difficult to tell the
difference between Androids and Humans; Aleer are roughly the same
height and weight as Humans, and biological sexual differences between
males and females follow Human patterns as well. At closer range, the
differences between the species are evident. Android "skin" can be of
any color (and some of the more flamboyant Androids opt in for
multi-colored skin as well) and interlaced with nanocircuitry and other
cyber enhancements. They are completely hairless on their bodies, and
what passes for "hair" on the tops of their heads is actually a dense
network of cables, fibers, and other synthetic devices. Their eyes, when
not enhanced with cyber gear, consist of small pupils with gray or
silver irises. Most androids do not wear external clothing among their
own kind, choosing instead to augment their outward appearances with
glowing tattoos, armored plates, or other appendages. However, for
modesty in the company of non-Aleer, most Androids will wear clothing.
Androids have the following characteristics where the game is
concerned:]{.c2 .c0}

-   [Androids begin play with a free NanoC]{.c6}[omputer]{.c0}[ (see
    CyberWare for more information). Note that Android characters must
    still spend batteries when activating this piece of CyberWare, and
    it otherwise functions as normal. This CyberWare is considered
    "free" in that an Android character with a FORT of 1 could still
    purchase an additional piece of CyberWare as normal above and beyond
    this starting piece.]{.c6}
-   [Androids can acquire up to 7 pieces of CyberWare instead of 6.
    ]{.c6}
-   [Androids begin play with one free rank in Computers. If a player
    wishes their Android character to begin play with further ranks,
    they may purchase them as normal. An Android character cannot begin
    play with a rank higher than 4 in Computers.]{.c6}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Fraal]{.c1}

[The Fraal are an ancient spacefaring species whose history is long and
convoluted. According to their history, a great colony ship was
dispatched from their home planet generations ago. In the course of
their centuries-long interstellar journey, technical complications
followed by civil unrest resulted in the loss of their own history. The
location of their home planet, as well as their purpose in setting out
to begin with, were all lost. It was in such a circumstance that the
first Fraal made contact with the galactic community, and the
now-dispossessed Fraal integrated into the Ekumen. Fraal are taller than
Humans, with the shortest Fraal standing at nearly 2 meters tall.
However, the Fraal are not a muscular species, being seen as "wispy" and
"frail" by non-Fraal. Fraal have silky-smooth black hair on their heads,
which is commonly braided into intricate patterns denoting status and
rank. They have no other body hair whatsoever, and their skin is pale
and smooth. Fraal eyes are large, oval, and nearly jet-black. They tend
to be slow and deliberate in their movements, but that belies a steady
determination and a quick response when necessary. All Fraal are
technically intersex due to the fact that individuals possess both male
and female sexual organs. As such, Fraal have no terms in their language
for "male" or "female," let alone gendered pronouns such as "he" or
"she." The reproductive cycle of Fraal is mysterious to non-Fraal,
giving rise to rumors that young Fraal are seeded in laboratories and
then incubated in embryonic tanks. Above all, the Fraal are
distinguished by their psionic ability. Even the least-talented Fraal
has some telepathic ability, and the greatest are sought as teachers of
psionic skills to others. Fraal have the following characteristics where
the game is concerned:]{.c2 .c0}

-   [Fraal begin play with one free rank in the psionic power Telepathy.
    Furthermore, Fraal Telepathy is superior in that Fraal do not need
    to see their intended target(s), though they are still limited by
    the 120 meter range. Finally, Fraal ]{.c6}[do not]{.c6 .c7}[ expend
    psychovolts when using Telepathy in this way (though Fraal
    characters who obtain Expertise Perks in Telepathy may be required
    to spend PV when using those powers). Telepathy is considered "free"
    in that a ]{.c6}[Fraal]{.c6}[ character with a PSI of 0 could still
    use Telepathy even though they do not possess any other psionic
    powers.  Fraal character can purchase an additional psionic power as
    normal above and beyond this starting power. All other rules about
    Telepathy apply as normal.]{.c6}
-   [Fraal can acquire up to 7 psionic powers instead of 6.]{.c6}
-   [Fraal begin play with one free rank in Occult. If a player wishes
    their Fraal character to begin play with further ranks, they may
    purchase them as normal. A Fraal character cannot begin play with a
    rank higher than 4 in Occult.]{.c6}

[]{.c1}

[Human]{.c1}

[The history and physiology of Humanity on Earth is well-documented
elsewhere and does not bear repeating here. Suffice to say that the
Human drive to explore, dominate, and spread continues as the species
expands into space. The Human spirit of ingenuity and diversity is
appreciated by the Ekumen, and Humans are by far the most numerous of
the species found in space. Humans have the following characteristics
where the game is concerned:]{.c2 .c0}

-   [Humans are very versatile, and have 6 extra XP to spend when
    starting a new character. These 6 extra XP are in addition to the
    starting XP that all characters calculate (see Character Creation
    for more information).]{.c2 .c0}
-   [When Human characters spend Luck points to reroll dice, if they
    still do not like the result, they can choose to keep the luck point
    and take the worse outcome of the two rolls, even if the results are
    the same.]{.c6}
-   [Humans begin play with one free rank in Charm. If a player wishes
    their Human character to begin play with further ranks, they may
    purchase them as normal. A Human character cannot begin play with a
    rank higher than 4 in Charm.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Sesheyan]{.c1}

[The Sesheyan are by far the most "alien" of the species so far
encountered by Humans or the Ekumen. Native to a dense and dark jungle
planet, Sheya, the Sesheyan are most at home when hiding and hunting in
the dark. ]{.c6}[Sesheyans]{.c6}[ stand slightly smaller than humans,
averaging around 1.5 meters in height. They are a completely hairless
species, and their skin resembles shark skin in tone and texture more
than any other (gray and sandpaper-like). ]{.c6}[Sesheyans]{.c6}[ are
masters in dark environments, having six small, round, black eyes
situated on an oblong "face," much like a spider. Their bodies are lithe
and muscular, and non-Sesheyan are at a loss to determine differences
between males and females, though there are distinct sexual differences
to the trained eye. The most pronounced feature of Sesheyans, however,
is their set of bat-like wings, which have a 2-meter wingspan. Using
these wings, ]{.c6}[Sesheyans]{.c6}[ are able to soundlessly glide and
fly at moderate speeds. Sesheyans have the following characteristics
where the game is concerned:]{.c2 .c0}

-   [Sesheyan characters have an additional movement type: flying.
    Sesheyans can fly and glide at the same rate as they can walk and
    swim (FORT+AGI meters/phase) in normal atmospheric conditions. If a
    Sesheyan character tries to perform a difficult maneuver while in
    flight, an Acrobatics check may be necessary.]{.c6}
-   [Sesheyans]{.c6}[ have extraordinary photoreceptors, and can see in
    absolute darkness and require no special technology or sensors to do
    so. Note that this special vision is independent of thermal,
    infrared, or other types of vision that can be detected by
    technology.]{.c6}
-   [Sesheyans]{.c6}[ begin play with one free rank in Stealth. If a
    player wishes their ]{.c6}[Sesheyan]{.c6}[ character to begin play
    with further ranks, they may purchase them as normal. A Sesheyan
    character cannot begin play with a rank higher than 4 in
    Stealth.]{.c6}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Tesa]{.c6 .c7}

[The Tesa are a quick, intelligent, curious, and welcomed species in the
Ekumen. Tesa are a reptilian species slightly smaller than Humans
(averaging 1.5 meters tall, though females are slightly larger). To
Humans, Tesa bring to mind various types of geckos, chameleons, and
lizards in their physiology and coloring (though Tesa females are
generally brighter and more vibrant than males). The Tesa originated in
an area of the galaxy with five nearby stars (known as the Tesa
Cluster). In the course of the development of Tesa civilization,
cryogenic technology was perfected to the point where the Tesa had
colonized all five of these star systems using conventional starship
engines (no stardrives) before encountering galactic civilization at
large. Tesa are nothing if not curious and intelligent, especially where
technology is concerned. Tesa have the following characteristics where
the game is concerned:]{.c2 .c0}

-   [Tesa characters have reptilian scales which function as natural
    Armor (see Gear descriptions for more details). However, Tesa
    characters do not suffer DA on Acrobatics, Athletics, Stealth, and
    Thievery checks since the benefit is natural.]{.c6}
-   [Tesa are quick to act, and so roll AD on all INIT checks.]{.c6}
-   [Tesa begin play with one free rank in Technology. If a player
    wishes their Tesa character to begin play with further ranks, they
    may purchase them as normal. A Tesa character cannot begin play with
    a rank higher than 4 in Technology.]{.c6}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[Weren]{.c1}

[Werens are a proud, noble, and warlike species. Native to the planet
Kurg, the history of the Weren species is filled with courageous
battles, betrayals, conquests, and defeats. In Weren culture, the
highest positions one can ascribe to (whether male or female) are to be
warrior or shaman. Even the shortest Werens stand over 2 meters tall,
and they can top out around 3 meters, with females only slightly shorter
than males. Furthermore, Werens are built for combat, with strong,
sturdy muscular bodies covered in thick fur. Weren fur varies in hue as
does Human skin color, and Weren eyes also resemble Human eyes in shape
and color. Most Werens do not wear clothing, letting their thick fur
bear witness to their prowess; sexual organs are concealed beneath their
thick fur regardless. Werens have the following characteristics where
the game is concerned:]{.c2 .c0}

-   [Werens have sharp claws on the ends of their hands which function
    as a natural Melee Weapon (see Gear descriptions for more details).
    And, because of the great size of Werens, they are able to attack a
    target within 2 meters with their claws, rather than 1.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [A Weren's fur has a natural shimmer and shine which gives them AD
    on any physical defense roll versus a ranged attack.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Werens begin play with one free rank in Melee. If a player wishes
    their Weren character to begin play with further ranks, they may
    purchase them as normal. A Weren character cannot begin play with a
    rank higher than 4 in Melee.]{.c2 .c0}

[]{.c2 .c0}

[STARDRIVE CAMPAIGN]{.c1}

[The Stardrive campaign is a classic "space opera" setting. The Solar
year is 2775 and the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy has been
thoroughly explored and colonized, though new frontiers on all reaches
of space continue to provide opportunities for the adventurous. Life in
the galaxy is plentiful, and Humanity has encountered five other
intelligent and sentient species. The galactic community as a whole is
referred to as the "Ekumen," but political unity is hard to come by.
Numerous states and factions vie for dominance in the reaches of space.
]{.c2 .c0}

-   [Gravitics: ]{.c6 .c7}[Gravitics (or gravity technology) is a key
    element of life in 2775. Spaceships and stations are able to have
    artificial gravity for the benefit of their inhabitants, and
    sub-light propulsion is done through gravitic technology by tricking
    ships to "fall" forward through space.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Fusion:]{.c6 .c7}[ Nuclear fusion has supplied the Ekumen with a
    virtually limitless supply of energy, and safe fusion reactors power
    everything from cities to ships. That said, accidents can happen,
    and spent nuclear fuel is a now-common hazard.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Stardrive: ]{.c6 .c7}[The key piece of technology that defines this
    campaign is the stardrive, an engine that permits faster-than-light
    travel. The stardrive combines both gravitics and fusion technology,
    opening a rift in the fabric of space that connects two distant
    points. The bigger the stardrive (which also requires more energy to
    operate), the farther distance traveled, but only massive ships and
    space stations can power and carry a stardrive of large size. The
    smallest ships equipped with stardrives (luxury yachts and small
    freighters) generally have a distance range of up to 6 light years,
    while the biggest ships (military dreadnoughts and city-ships) can
    travel up to 36 light years in a single "jump." Smaller spacecraft
    such as fighters and other personal ships are not equipped with
    stardrives; those ships must hitch a ride in a larger vessel in
    order to cross the galaxy. Ships that travel using a stardrive leave
    regular space in a colorful flash and enter what is called
    "drivespace." While in drivespace, a ship is essentially stationary.
    Looking out a viewing port or window reveals a random kaleidoscope
    of colors, the meanings of which vary depending on the religion or
    philosophy of the traveler. Drivespace is also a dangerous place to
    be, however; ships must ensure that their hulls and airlocks are
    sealed prior to engaging the stardrive to prevent the stuff of
    drivespace from entering. Ships that have opened airlocks while in
    drivespace are never heard from again. A journey through drivespace
    always takes exactly 216 Solar hours (9 Solar days) regardless of
    distance traveled. Therefore, ships making jumps need to be
    well-prepared with food, water, and berthing for passengers. Upon
    emerging from drivespace, a ship's stardrive must go through a
    period of "cooling down" before making another jump. For every
    lightyear traveled, the stardrive must cool down for 2 Solar hours.
    Stardrives can only operate by bending the fabric of space;
    attempting to activate a stardrive in an atmosphere will result in a
    nuclear explosion, the size of which is determined by the size of
    the stardrive..]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Ansible: ]{.c6 .c7}[The ansible is a technology that permits
    communication between star systems. These types of communication
    include radio and electrical signals, but they do not have mass, so
    they do not require a stardrive to be sent. The ansible uses
    gravitics to "bundle" these radio and electronic messages and send
    them at faster-than-light speed. Ansibles are large devices, but are
    found in most every structure and ship. They are generally too large
    to be carried by an individual. Messages sent by ansible travel at a
    speed of 1 lightyear every three Solar hours. Delayed messages and
    responses are essential facts of life in the far reaches of the
    galaxy. ]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Star Systems: ]{.c6 .c7}[Due to the incredible distances between
    them, it requires a lot of time to communicate and travel from one
    star system to another. As such, each star system is
    quasi-independent. ]{.c6}

[]{.c1}

[ENDARKENMENT CAMPAIGN]{.c1}

[2212 CE. Earth. The Endarkenment. The specifics of the world will be
(for the most part) collaboratively built between the players and the
GM, but there are some facets of the world that are unchangeable:]{.c2
.c0}

-   [Climate Change: ]{.c6 .c7}[The absolute worst-case scenarios of
    climate change have come true, and then some. Global temperatures
    have risen and weather patterns have altered. All glaciers around
    the world have melted, raising seas to significant and devastating
    levels (65 meters above present sea levels). During the winter
    seasons in each hemisphere ocean ice appears, sometimes, but it
    quickly disappears upon summer temperatures. Weather patterns have
    changed around the world to affect agriculture and human life. The
    human cost of climate change has been unprecedented; wars, famine,
    species extinction, refugee crises, diseases, droughts, and more are
    commonplace. Lesser developed countries are more at risk of these
    consequences, but even first-world nations are dealing with
    climate-related issues. Needless to say the effects of climate
    change in 2212 are felt by everyone.]{.c2 .c0}
-   [Psionics:]{.c6 .c7}[ Psionic ability has manifested itself upon
    humanity. Some humans are innately born with abilities only heard of
    in myth and legend; others can later develop this ability with
    intense focus and training, under the tutelage of another psionic.
    Different nations, cultures, and religions view psionic ability
    differently, and have differing laws, policies, regulations, and
    attitudes towards psionics. In the general population psionics are
    rare, occurring in roughly one out of 200 births at random.]{.c2
    .c0}
-   [Cyberware: ]{.c6 .c7}[Technology has progressed to the point where
    human and machine can be effectively joined to create truly
    cybernetic persons. Nanotechnology has permitted circuitry to
    interweave with the nervous system, allowing for conscious control
    of computerized implants. Choosing to become "cybered" is an
    expensive and laborious process, generally available to only
    powerful governments, corporations, or to the very affluent (or the
    criminal).]{.c6}
