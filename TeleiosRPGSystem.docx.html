class="c1">INTRODUCTION</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Welcome to Teleios! This roleplaying game system is primarily geared towards campaigns set anytime from the modern to the far-future, however, it could be easily adapted to other settings with some slight modifications. Given the versatility of this system, there are some components that gamemasters (GMs) will want to include, while there are others that are optional, depending on the style and flavor of the campaign they are running. The rules that follow assume the reader has familiarity with other tabletop roleplaying games, but effort will be made at clarifying confusing points. Please enjoy reading these rules, and feel free to comment and critique as necessary. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">THE STORY</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Regardless of the specific campaign, Teleios is designed to be story-driven. While the GM will be the prime storyteller, the players will also have key roles in creating the campaign and story. The collaboration between the GM and the players isn&rsquo;t one of competition necessarily, but one of mutual creativity and fun. For example, rules will exist in this game wherein the players are given the ability to modify the story; in such a case, the players and the GM should collectively agree on the story and plot changes that will be introduced. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c7">SKILLS INSTEAD OF CLASSES</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">There are no classes in Teleios. Instead, player characters select skills which depict what they are good at doing. A flexible skill-based system offers characters more options for abilities, powers, and knowledge versus being labeled as a &ldquo;fighter&rdquo; and succumbing to the limitations that descriptor entails. A traditional &ldquo;fighter&rdquo; in Teleios could not only be good at combat, but could also be a movie buff, a dancer, and have an interest in the occult. Selecting skills in those areas would not penalize this character as they might in other game systems. Furthermore, a skill-based system is more &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; in that everyone in reality has a wide panoply of skills, interest, and abilities which are not easily shoehorned into a one-word label like &ldquo;medic,&rdquo; &ldquo;mechanic,&rdquo; or &ldquo;mystic.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">THE GAME MECHANIC</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Players</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;roll </span><span class="c6 c7">no fewer than one</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;but </span><span class="c6 c7">no more than twelve </span><span class="c0">six-sided dice in or</span><span class="c6">der to perform </span><span class="c6 c7">actions</span><span class="c0">. Rolling dice is called a </span><span class="c6 c7 c13">check</span><span class="c0">. The number of dice rolled is equal to </span><span class="c6">the sum of a character&rsquo;s rank in a Skill or psionic Power and its corresponding Attribute, so more talent and training allows characters to roll more dice, giving a greater chance of success. </span><span class="c0">A result of 5 on a die scores one </span><span class="c6 c7 c13">hit</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;and a result of 6 on a die scores two hits. A result of 1 on a die subtracts one hit. Results of 2, 3, and 4 have no effect. After the check is made, the player adds all hits together. The resulting number of hits determines, by degree, the level of success (or failure) that results from the attempted action. </span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_1-0 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">&le;0 hits = Marginal/Failure.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The attempted action does not succeed, and the GM gets to </span><span class="c6">t</span><span class="c0">ake </span><span class="c6">a </span><span class="c6 c7">reaction</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c6">Reactions made by the GM</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">are usually</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;some sort of complication or detrimental effect to the characters. </span><span class="c6">GM reactions</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;can take many forms; for instance, the GM may decide that an enemy attacks a character, or that the character is noticed by an enemy. Conversely, maybe the GM decides that there is unwelcome news for the character, or the character suffers monetary or equipment loss. Generally speaking, the GM should design </span><span class="c6">their reactions</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;around the attempted action that a character attempted. Also no</span><span class="c6">te that depending on the circumstances, it may be impossible (or otherwise undesirable, for story reasons) for a character to &ldquo;fail&rdquo; a check outright; in such cases Teleios allows for a &ldquo;marginal&rdquo; success in which the player&rsquo;s action succeeds, but the GM is allowed to take </span><span class="c6 c7">two</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;reactions as a result. </span></li></ul><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_1-1 start"><li class="c3 c20 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">More about reactions: GM reactions may be &ldquo;saved&rdquo; for a later time, but the GM can only carry up to three saved reactions between game sessions. Like mentioned in &ldquo;The Story&rdquo; above, GM reactions, while proposed by the GM, should be ultimately agreed upon by the players and GM. </span></li></ul><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_1-0"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">1-3 hits = Ordinary.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;The attempted action succeeds, but the GM gets to </span><span class="c6">take one reaction</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;as well.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">4-5 hits = Good. </span><span class="c0">The attempted action succeeds</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;with no accompanying GM reaction.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">6&le; hits = Amazing. </span><span class="c0">The attempted action succeeds with an added </span><span class="c6 c7 c13">bonus</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to the character. The character can choose the form of the bonus (</span><span class="c6">considerin</span><span class="c0">g GM and group </span><span class="c6">advice and consent</span><span class="c0">). For example, a character may decide that the attempted action succeeds to such a degree that the action requires less time, or stays in effect longer, or deals more damage, etc. As a rule of thumb, any bonus that adds to the efficacy of the attempted action should be no more than </span><span class="c6 c7 c13">33% better</span><span class="c0">. For example, if a Melee attack normally deals 1d6 (LI) body damage, an Amazing result would deal 1d6+2 (LI) body damage. The character might also decide that as a result of their a</span><span class="c6">maz</span><span class="c0">ing success, the next related action they</span><span class="c6">, or an ally, attempts</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;has advantage.</span></li></ul><p class="c3 c4 c23"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">It is important to note that t</span><span class="c0">he GM n</span><span class="c6">ever rolls</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;dice. GM reactions are only taken as a result of Marginal/Failure and Ordinary results from </span><span class="c6">player actions. </span><span class="c0">In cases where an enemy would attack a character, </span><span class="c6">a player rolls that</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;character&rsquo;s appropriate defense to determine the enemy&rsquo;s degree of success. The player would then roll damage dice for their character as well. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">A note on rounding: In cases where rounding needs to take place, </span><span class="c6 c7">round in the way which tells a good story</span><span class="c6">. In other cases, </span><span class="c6 c7">round to the benefit of the characters</span><span class="c6">. For instance, if a character recovers half of their three used Luck points during a rest, they would recover two of the used three. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Certain situations may make it more or less likely for a character to succeed at an action. In cases where the character has a greater chance to succeed, this is called </span><span class="c6 c7 c13">advantage </span><span class="c0">(abbreviated </span><span class="c6 c7 c13">AD</span><span class="c0">), and in cases where the character has a smaller chance to succeed, this is called </span><span class="c6 c7 c13">disadvantage</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(abbreviated </span><span class="c6 c7 c13">DA</span><span class="c0">). When making a check with advantage, results of 4 add one hit to the total, whereas normally they have no effect. When making a check with disadvantage, results of 5 have no effect, whereas normally they score one hit. If a character would be granted advantage or disadvantage from multiple sources, its effects are only applied once--</span><span class="c6">there is no such thing as &ldquo;super advantage</span><span class="c0">!</span><span class="c6">&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;If a character has both advantage and disadvantage on a check, even from </span><span class="c6">multiple sources,</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;the two cancel each other out and the check is rolled as normal.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">LUCK</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Characters have a number of luck points (LP) equal to their AGI+3. When a character makes a check and dislikes the result, they may choose to spend a luck point to do one of the following actions:</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_4-0 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">Automatically add two hits to the result of the check</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">Re-roll any dice of the player&rsquo;s choosing in the check and use the new result</span></li></ul><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Only one luck point may be spent on any given check; for instance, a character could not spend two luck points to add four hits to a check. Likewise, if a player chooses to reroll some dice from their check, they must use the new result and cannot use a second luck point to reroll again. Characters regain one used luck point </span><span class="c6">when taking a rest, and restore all of their available luck points upon achieving a milestone.</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_41-0 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">NOTE: </span><span class="c0">Cybered characters who activate a piece of </span><span class="c6">CyberWare</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(and therefore add dice to their pool) </span><span class="c6">are able to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;reroll ALL of their dice when spending LP, including their added dice from their </span><span class="c6">CyberWare</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;activation.</span></li></ul><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">ATTRIBUTES</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">All characters have four basic attributes: Fortitude (FORT), Agility (AGI), Intellect (INT), and Personality (PERS). Character scores in these attributes can range from 1-6; however, as a </span><span class="c6 c7">starting character</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;no attribute may begin play above rank 4. Details on the attributes are below.</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Fortitude (FORT)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;represents a character&rsquo;s strength, toughness, and stamina. FORT is important for the Athletics, Endurance, and Melee skills. It is also a factor in melee damage, calculating ma</span><span class="c6">ximum pieces of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">CyberWare</span><span class="c2 c0">, body and stun durability, actions per round, and physical defense.</span></li></ul><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_2-1 start"><li class="c3 c20 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Expertise Perks: </span></li></ul><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_2-2 start"><li class="c3 c24 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">When FORT is referenced as part of a check for skills &nbsp;(for example, when rolling damage for the Melee skill), this perk allows the character to use 2x their FORT score, rather than just their FORT score. So a character with this Expertise Perk and a FORT score of 4 would add 8 to damage from the Melee skill rather than 4.</span></li><li class="c3 c24 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1"></span></li></ul><p class="c3 c4 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_2-0"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Agility (AGI) </span><span class="c2 c0">represents a character&rsquo;s quickness, balance, and speed. AGI is important for the Acrobatics, Ranged, Stealth, Thievery, and Vehicles skills. It is also used to calculate luck points, initiative order, and physical defense.</span></li></ul><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_2-1 start"><li class="c3 c20 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Expertise Perks:</span></li></ul><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_2-2 start"><li class="c3 c24 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">When AGI is used to add to a roll as part of a skill check (for example, when rolling ranged damage), this perk allows the character to use 2x their AGI score, rather than just their AGI score.

INT is important for the Bureaucracy, Computers, Deduce, </span><span class="c6">Humanities</span><span class="c0">, Medicine, Outdoors, Science, Search, Tactics, and Technology skills. It is also important for calculating beginning XP, initiative order, some psionic</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;skills</span><span class="c2 c0">, and mental defense.</span></li></ul><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_3-1 start"><li class="c3 c20 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Expertise Perks:</span></li></ul><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_3-2 start"><li class="c3 c24 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Linguist: </span><span class="c2 c0">The character knows an additional 2 languages (this perk may be taken more than once).</span></li></ul><p class="c3 c4 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_3-0"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Personality (PERS)</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;represents a character&rsquo;s willpower, sanity, and charisma. PERS is important for the Animals, Charm, Deception, Occult, Resolve, and Streetwise skills. It factors into a character&rsquo;s mental defense, actions per round</span><span class="c6">, some</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;psionic</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;skills</span><span class="c2 c0">, and stun durability.</span></li></ul><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_3-1 start"><li class="c3 c20 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Expertise Perks:</span></li></ul><p class="c3 c4 c28"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">OPTIONAL ATTRIBUTES</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Additionally, all characters have two optional attributes: Cyberware (CYB) and Psionics (PSI). A player may choose to acquire ranks in PSI or CYB or both (or neither), whether at character creation or later as the character gains XP. Both PSI and CYB may be increased in rank from 1-6; however, if a character has ranks in both PSI and CYB, the</span><span class="c6 c7">&nbsp;sum of those two cannot exceed 6</span><span class="c0">. For instance, a character choosing to specialize in </span><span class="c6">CyberWare</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;may have a CYB score of 6, but that same character would then be prohibited from acquiring any psionic abilities whatsoever. Specific details on the optional attributes are described later </span><span class="c6">in the Psionics and CyberWare sections, respectively</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">DEFENSES</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Characters have two defenses that are checked when they are attacked by enemies or by the environment: physical defense (</span><span class="c6 c7 c13">PD</span><span class="c0">) and mental defense (</span><span class="c6 c7 c13">MD</span><span class="c0">). A character checks their physical defense when an enemy targets their body (such as with a </span><span class="c6">M</span><span class="c0">elee or </span><span class="c6">R</span><span class="c2 c0">anged attack). A character checks their mental defense when an enemy targets their willpower or sanity (such as with Deception or certain psionic attacks). Both physical and mental defense range from 2-12 dice (FORT+AGI for physical defense and INT+PERS for mental defense). When a check is necessary, the character rolls the appropriate defense and calculates levels of success as normal. The result (Failure, Ordinary, Good, or Amazing) dictates the effect of the attack on the character.</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_k3qi2h27gold-0 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Marginal/Failure = </span><span class="c2 c0">The character suffers the negative effects of the attack, and also suffers an additional setback from the attack. Examples might include rolling DA on their next check, or else amplifying the negative effects of the attack by an additional 33%. The additional setback should be story-driven and should be collaboratively decided between the player and GM.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Ordinary = </span><span class="c2 c0">The character suffers the negative effects of the attack, but no further setback.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Good = </span><span class="c2 c0">The character does not suffer any negative effects from the attack.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Amazing = </span><span class="c6">The character does not suffer any negative effects from the attack. Additionally, the character may roll their next check with AD </span><span class="c6 c7">or</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;may negate the next reaction taken by the GM (player chooses).</span></li></ul><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">INITIATIVE &amp; ACTIONS</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Combat encounters are divided into &ldquo;rounds.&rdquo; Each round in combat is equal to </span><span class="c6">20</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;seconds in game time; therefore, </span><span class="c6">3</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;rounds equal 1 minute. Furthermore, each round of 20 seconds is divided into </span><span class="c6">four</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;phases,&rdquo; each lasting </span><span class="c6">5</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;seconds. The </span><span class="c6">four</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;phases in each round relate to one of the degrees of success; in order, the Amazing, Good, Ordinary, and Margina</span><span class="c6">l degrees</span><span class="c0">. In cases where it is important to know who acts first, such as in a combat, characters roll an initiative (</span><span class="c6 c7 c13">INIT</span><span class="c0">) check. Initiative ranges from 2-12 dice, and is calculated by </span><span class="c6 c7">AGI+INT</span><span class="c0">. When a check is necessary, the character rolls initiative and calculates levels of success as normal. The result (Amazing, Good, Ordinary, or Marginal) </span><span class="c6">dictates the phase</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;in which characters may make their actions. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When combat begins, all characters involved roll INIT. The result of that check (Amazing, Good,</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;Ordinary, or Marginal</span><span class="c0">) determines the phase in which that character can first act. Thereafter, characters may make an action in any subsequent phase (provided they have actions available). So, if a character rolls a Good result on th</span><span class="c6">eir initiative check</span><span class="c0">, they cannot act in the Amazing phase (which comes first), but can take an action when the Good phase comes up. Since there are only </span><span class="c6">four</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;phases per combat round, it is likely that multiple characters (and enemies) will act in the same phase. All actions in a phase are considered to occur simultaneously, with the effects of those actions taking effect at the end of the phase. So, if a character and an enemy NPC both successfully attack each other in the Ordinary phase, both receive damage at the end of th</span><span class="c6">at</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;phase but before the start of the Marginal phase. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">In all combat phases, a character </span><span class="c6">may</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;move and attempt an action. Some mo</span><span class="c6">des of movement (running, jumping, etc.) can impose disadvantage on various checks. </span><span class="c0">A character can make as many actions per round as they have actions available (see Actions per Round). So, if a character has two actions per round and rolls a Good result on their INIT check, they can begin to take actions beginning in the Good phase. Thereafter, the second action could be taken in the Ordinary phase or the Marginal phase (</span><span class="c6">player choice)</span><span class="c2 c0">. That equates to (as an example):</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_37-1 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">One action in each the Good and Ordinary phases</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">One action in each the Good and Marginal phases (delaying the second action)</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">One action in each the Ordinary and Marginal phases (delaying both actions)</span></li></ul><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Note that if a character first acts in the Marginal phase (the last combat phase), they can only take one action that round. This may mean that characters lose actions because they didn&rsquo;t act quickly enough. At the end of the Marginal phase (and therefore the combat round), all participating combatants re-roll their INIT and the next round begins with the Amazing phase. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Some situations, skills, and CyberWare can grant characters a Surprise round. A Surprise round in combat is granted due to superior positioning, preparation, and/or guile. A Surprise round occurs before the Amazing round in a combat scene. Each character and NPC participating in a Surprise round can move and take one action as normal, but those actions are rolled with advantage against all who do not act. A character acting in a Surprise round against an NPC also acting in the Surprise round would gain the extra movement and action, but would not roll that action with advantage. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">SKILLS</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Nearly everything characters can do in </span><span class="c6">Teleios</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is represented by skills. Each skill is tied to one of the four basic attributes and can have a rank of 0 (untrained) to 6. </span><span class="c6 c7">A beginning character cannot have a skill with a rank higher than 4.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;When making a skill check, the character adds the number of ranks in the selected skill (between 0 and 6) with their rank in the linked attribute (between 1 and 6) and rolls that many dice for the check. As an example, a character who makes a Ranged check adds their ranks in the Ranged skill with their ranks in AGI (the linked attribute). Note that this same basic system is used for psionic powers, w</span><span class="c6">ith a couple of notable changes (see Psionics below).</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">UNTRAINED</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">When a character has 0 ranks in a skill or psionic power, they are considered to be </span><span class="c6 c7">untrained</span><span class="c0">. In some cases a character may not use a skill untrained (as in the case of psionic powers). In all other cases, </span><span class="c6 c7">using a skill untrained imposes disadvantage</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;on the skill check.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">PERKS</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Perks are special, unique abilities associated with skills, psionic powers, and attributes that players can tailor to their character concept and style of play (pending GM approval). There are t</span><span class="c6">wo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;levels of perks: training perks</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;and</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;expertise perks.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Training Perks</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Training perks only apply to skills. When a character is trained (has at least one rank) in a skill, they have the opportunity to purchase training perks. Training perks are</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">not very powerful, but they should incentivize and encourage creative playing. Training perks must be purchased at the cost of one XP each, and some players may choose to spend XP elsewhere rather than specialize on training perks. A character </span><span class="c6">is not limited to the number of training perks they purchase, but a player cannot obtain multiple training perks that grant the same benefit for the same skill</span><span class="c2 c0">. Each training perk should be unique, and should be collaboratively decided between the player and the GM, but generally speaking, training perks can do the following:</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_6-0 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Specialization: </span><span class="c2 c0">Provide advantage on skill checks in certain situations.</span></li></ul><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_6-1 start"><li class="c3 c20 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Example:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A character gains a perk in Melee that gives them advantage to attacking an enemy who is currently </span><span class="c6">fighting</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;with at least one other ally.</span></li><li class="c3 c20 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Example:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A character gains a perk in </span><span class="c6">Humanities</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;that gives them advantage on checks dealing with native Mesoamerican tribes.</span></li><li class="c3 c20 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Example:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;A character gains a perk in Search that gives them advantage when using the skill </span><span class="c6">in desert environments</span><span class="c0">.</span></li></ul><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_6-0"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Contacts: </span><span class="c0">Give the character beneficial contacts in the world. </span><span class="c6">In some cases the contact can provide shelter, information, or other resources to benefit the character.

In other words, a character with a rank of 5 in Deception could have up to 2 expertise perks (one each for rank 4 and rank 5), but they could not have a third expertise perk until attaining rank 6 in that skill. Of course, that same character with a rank 5 in Deception could choose to have no expertise perks in that skill--they are optional just as training perks. This also means that no skill, psionic power, or attribute may have more than three expertise perks. </span><span class="c0">Expertise perks are listed for all skills, powers, and attributes, but </span><span class="c6">other options</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">c</span><span class="c0">ould be collaboratively created between the player and the GM if none of the listed perks suit your character</span><span class="c6">&rsquo;s style of play</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c6">Characters who choose to retrain an expertise perk for another would still need to spend 1 XP in order to do so.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">CHARACTER CREATION</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Since Teleios tries to emphasize story, players are encouraged to think of &ldquo;who&rdquo; their character is first and foremost, rather than simply a collection of stats (which are admittedly important!). A good way to begin is to think of characters from popular books, movies, or other media that appeal to players, and use that as a starting point. Another option would be to peruse the Character Traits, Ideals, and Bonds section (see below) for some inspiration. A final word about character creation would be to work closely with your GM (and maybe other players as well), since they will undoubtedly have ideas about how your character figures into their campaign. For example, perhaps not all of the species are available for players to play. Alternatively, maybe the history of the campaign setting is such that it could directly tie into a character&rsquo;s backstory.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Attribute Selection</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Aft</span><span class="c6">er having an idea of who their character is, a</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;player </span><span class="c6">then</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;choos</span><span class="c6">es</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a species, and </span><span class="c6">also chooses</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;one of the standard attribute arrays below, assigning the scores as they see fit</span><span class="c6">.

And while every GM is different, here are some suggested guidelines:</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_f7cpc3ddfec2-0 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Good Role-Playing: </span><span class="c2 c0">It is advised that the GM award players with extra XP each per session for good role-playing. It is important to note that this should not be punitive in any way on players, but instead should reward good storytelling and developments that tie in to character ideals, traits, and bonds. 1 XP (or 2 for exceptional role-playing) is a good rule of thumb.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Awesome Moment: </span><span class="c2 c0">Every player and GM has been in a game when something truly awesome happens. Maybe a character makes a one-in-a-million shot, or pilots their ship with verve and skill. Perhaps the characters collectively place themselves in such a funny, terrifying, or unique situation that it creates awesome memories. GMs are encouraged to award 1 extra XP for such moments to any and all players involved. </span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Milestones: </span><span class="c2 c0">When characters attain a milestone by advancing the plot of the story in a significant way, XP should be awarded commensurately, between 1-3 XP per player.</span></li></ul><p class="c3 c4 c23"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">RETRAINING</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Sometimes characters realize that choices they made with regards to skills, psionic powers, </span><span class="c6">CyberWare</span><span class="c0">, perks, and/or attributes were poor choices, and they wish to &ldquo;undo&rdquo; those choices. Such a circumstance calls for retraining. Retraining is always possible at any time (the players should be able to modify and optimize their characters to suit their style of play), but retraining is not without cost. In order to retrain 1 rank in anything (skills, psionic powers, </span><span class="c6">CyberWare</span><span class="c0">, perks, or attributes) the character must spend 1 XP, which is lost in the course of retraining; however, that character then gains back the XP spent on the </span><span class="c6">lost rank, CyberWare, or perk</span><span class="c0">. The regained XP can then be spent or saved as normal. For example, if a character has rank 3 in the psionic power Shield and wishes to retrain it, they would first spend 1 XP to drop their rank in Shield to 2. They would then have 2 XP (the cost of</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Shield from </span><span class="c6">rank 2 to 3</span><span class="c0">) to spend or save as normal. </span><span class="c6">Bear in mind that if a player retrains a skill, psionic power, or attribute which would result in the loss of an expertise perk, those perks associated with that retrained rank are also lost (but the character would gain back the extra XP as well). </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">RESTING</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">During the course of play, characters will want to (and need to) take a break from the action in order to restore lost durability, psychovolts, and batteries. In game terms, these characters &ldquo;rest&rdquo; from their activities. In order to rest, characters need to declare that they are resting. Doing so means that the characters spend the next six hours of game-time sleeping, relaxing, meditating, or otherwise not performing arduous tasks. While resting, characters can attempt to use skills and powers to recover lost durability, batteries, and psychovolts; more detail on recovery is provided in the following sections. Additionally, all characters automatically restore one Luck Point when resting, not to exceed their maximums. In some cases (GM discretion) it may not be possible for characters to rest. For example, if the characters are sneaking their way into a hostile organization&rsquo;s secret military base, a rest in the middle of that scene would not be appropriate. Resting is not without consequence; whenever characters rest, the GM is able to advance the plot without the characters&rsquo; interference. This may mean (for instance) that an enemy gets closer to their goal while the characters rested, or that an upcoming task will be more difficult for the characters due to their dalliance. This evens the odds, since the characters will be stronger, but so will their opposition.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.f705639638dabbc7c35b17db2b2b631cd2cad14a"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c22"><tr class="c16"><td class="c18 c33" colspan="2" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Quick Reference when Resting</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c14"><td class="c30 c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Luck Points</span></p></td><td class="c31" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><ul class="c9 lst-kix_l4r2vdgylzld-0 start"><li class="c8 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">Automatically restore 1 Luck Point, if able</span></li></ul></td></tr><tr class="c14"><td class="c30 c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Stun Durability</span></p></td><td class="c31" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><ul class="c9 lst-kix_sz5iuowaoifh-0 start"><li class="c8 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">Automatically restore all STUN durability</span></li></ul></td></tr><tr class="c14"><td class="c19 c30" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Endurance (1x)</span></p></td><td class="c31" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><ul class="c9 lst-kix_b6g4x6mnazha-0 start"><li class="c8 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">Success: Restore 1 BODY durability in self</span></li></ul></td></tr><tr class="c14"><td class="c30 c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Medicine (1x)</span></p></td><td class="c31" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><ul class="c9 lst-kix_d7c7qm4h01r1-0 start"><li class="c8 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">Success: Restore 1d3 BODY durability (or 1d6 with a medical kit) in self or other (all characters)</span></li></ul></td></tr><tr class="c14"><td class="c30 c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Resolve (1x)</span></p></td><td class="c31" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><ul class="c9 lst-kix_xew3d9czlto2-0 start"><li class="c8 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">Success: Restore 3 psychovolts to self (psionic characters only)</span></li></ul></td></tr><tr class="c14"><td class="c30 c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8"><span class="c1">Technology (1x)</span></p></td><td class="c31" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><ul class="c9 lst-kix_y5640pps5l9n-0 start"><li class="c8 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">Success: Repair one broken item or piece of CyberWare</span></li><li class="c8 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">Success: Restore 3 batteries to self (cybered characters only)</span></li></ul></td></tr></table><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">MILESTONES</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Since the Teleios game system is a story-driven system, there will come various times when the characters will resolve certain plotlines, or will otherwise move the direction of the story to new areas. Such occurrences are called </span><span class="c6 c7">milestones</span><span class="c2 c0">. The GM decides when the characters have achieved a milestone. At each milestone, all lost durability, luck, psychovolts, and batteries are restored. If characters possess Gear which &ldquo;recharges&rdquo; at each milestone, then those do so. Additionally, it is recommended that the GM award characters between 1-3 XP which aligns to the significance of the milestone. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">PSIONICS</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">Psionics (PSI) is an optional attribute that can be raised from 1-6 as can the basic attributes. Even if a starting character begins with 0 PSI, ranks can be added later by purchasing ranks in the PSI attribute as normal. A starting character cannot have a PSI score higher than rank 4. PERS is the attribute most important for psionic characters, as it is used to calculate psychovolts and adds to some powers; however, INT is also a key attri</span><span class="c6">bute for many psionic powers. </span><span class="c0">The following rules apply to characters with a PSI score of at leas</span><span class="c6">t one</span><span class="c2 c0">:</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_7-0 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A character&rsquo;s PSI score = the maximum number of psionic powers that the character can have ranks in. For example, a character with a PSI of 3 can have up to three different powers available to them, but cannot gain a fourth power until their PSI score increases to 4. Of course, that same character might choose to only have 1 or 2 psionic powers available. Note that this means (technically) that a character could have a PSI score of at least one, but </span><span class="c6">have no trained psionic powers to use--not very optimal. Also n</span><span class="c0">ote that this means that the maximum number of psionic powers available to a character is 6, because a character&rsquo;s maximum PSI score is 6 (although Fraal </span><span class="c6">characters can have up to 7 psionic powers because of their free use of Telepathy)</span><span class="c0">. </span><span class="c6">Psionic characters tend to specialize in certain powers at the expense of others. C</span><span class="c0">hoose wisel</span><span class="c6">y!</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">When making a check with a psionic power, the character adds their ranks in the power itself along with the character&rsquo;s PSI score (2-12 dice). This operates the same way </span><span class="c6">as normal </span><span class="c2 c0">skills.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Psionic powers may</span><span class="c6 c7">&nbsp;not</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;be used untrained</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;under any circumstances.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Training perks are </span><span class="c6 c7">not</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;available for purchase for psionic powers, nor is there gear associated with psionic powers. Psionic characters may, however, purchase expertise perks at ranks 4, 5, and 6 normally.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Psionic powers require psychovolts to use. A character&rsquo;s total psychovolts (PV) are equal to their PERS+3. </span><span class="c6">C</span><span class="c0">haracters with no PSI sc</span><span class="c6">ore and no </span><span class="c0">psionic powers have no need </span><span class="c6">to calculate PV.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">For every usage (</span><span class="c6">regardless </span><span class="c0">of success degree or failure) of a psionic power, a character subtracts 1 psychovolt (PV) from their total. If 0 PV remain, the character may still attempt to use a power, but suffers DA on the check. In such a case, the psionic character also incurs 2 (ME) stun damage for every usage (whether success or failure) of a psionic power. This stun damage cannot be absorb</span><span class="c6">ed by any means.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">All PV are restored after the GM gives the character a </span><span class="c6">milestone</span><span class="c0">. Additionally, a psionic character may use the Resolve skill </span><span class="c6">once </span><span class="c2 c0">during a rest to restore lost PV. Success restores 3 PV (not to exceed the character&rsquo;s maximum). See the Resolve skill for more information.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A psionic power that has the </span><span class="c6 c7 c13">&ldquo;extend&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;keyword may have its effects extended beyond the normal duration of the power. Upon the expiry of the power&rsquo;s normal duration, a psionic character may spend 1 additional PV to continue the use of that power uninterrupted for a length of time equal to the power&rsquo;s normal duration. No additional check needs to be made when extending a power. For example, if a character with an INT of 2 has been using Telepathy to speak with another (for up to 5 minutes) and wants to continue doing so beyond those 5 minutes, they would simply declare that intent and spend an additional PV to continue the power&rsquo;s use for up to another 5 minutes. In cases where a psionic character wishes to extend a power but has no psychovolts remaining, they may choose to extend the power for half of the normal duration, </span><span class="c6">and</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;must incur 2 (ME) stun damage. </span><span class="c6">Regardless of situation, psionic p</span><span class="c0">owers may only be extended once before the strain is too much and</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;the psionic character needs to end the usage of that power</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Multiple uses of psionic powers with the &ldquo;extend&rdquo; keyword may be in effect at any one time. For example, a psionic character may be utilizing both Cloak and Metabolism (after having paid the cost in psychovolts), or may be using Metabolism twice in order to increase both FORT and AGI separately. In such </span><span class="c6">cases, the psionic character may choose to pay additional PV to keep the powers in effect after their normal duration.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Psionic characters </span><span class="c6 c7">must</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;choose a psionic detriment, listed below.

So a character with a PERS score of 2 would add 4 to damage from Bolt, rather than 2, and a character with an INT of 3 would have a base duration of 6 hours, rather than 3, with Persuasion.</span></li><li class="c3 c24 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Conservationist: </span><span class="c2 c0">Three times per milestone, when the psionic character fails a check with a psionic power, they do not expend PV.

Examples might include a heavy jewel on the end of a necklace or a crystal ball. The talisman must be carried or worn by the character in order to use psionic powers normally. Additionally, the talisman cannot serve any other purpose (such as acting as a melee weapon or a personal computer). A character with this detriment who attempts to use a power without their talisman suffers DA. If a character&rsquo;s talisman is lost or otherwise permanently destroyed, the psionic character may make another via the Occult skill.

When used, the character not only increases their maximum durability, but also restores half (rounded up) of the added durability they added. For example, a character with a PERS of 3 chooses to increase their BODY durability. They roll 2 on 1d6, meaning that they increase their max BODY durability by 5 for the duration. Additionally, they would also immediately heal 3 BODY durability (half of 5, rounded up).

If the possessing character takes actions that would endanger the well-being of their target (or someone or something dear to the target), the possessing psionic character must first roll a Mental Defense check. Failure means that the possession ends and the target regains control of their consciousness. While in possession of another, the psionic character&rsquo;s body falls into a catatonic state.

In the first instance, a character may spend BP to restore BODY and/or STUN durability. For every BP spent, the cybered character may recover 1d3 BODY or 1d6 STUN durability. The cybered character must choose which durability to restore </span><span class="c6 c7">before</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;rolling dice, and each die must be rolled separately (i.e. a character who spends 3 BP to restore BODY points would roll 3d6 and would calculate their healing accordingly.

The second active use of the ERSlot is one in which the cybered character is knocked unconscious (see &ldquo;Knockouts&rdquo; for more information). If a cybered character with an ERSlot is knocked out with 1 or more BP left to spend, that character may choose to spend BP in order to revive themselves. Instead of remaining unconscious for 6 combat rounds, the cybered character is only unconscious for 1 round, after which they awaken with STUN durability equal to their (FORT+PERS)xBP spent. So, if a character with a FORT of 3 and a PERS of 2 spent 2 batteries on recovering in this fashion, they would recover from being knocked out with 10 STUN.

Spending BP in this way is completely optional, so a round in which a character rolls a Failure on their INIT check would not need to waste a BP on extra actions. Cybered characters can spend between 1-3 BP adding extra actions in this way, however, the effect of spending the BP is immediate; there is no 10-minute duration on the extra actions, and cybered characters</span><span class="c6 c7">&nbsp;cannot </span><span class="c2 c0">roll Technology to attempt to recover BP spent in this way during a scene.</span></li></ul><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Hidden</span><span class="c6 c7">Compartment</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_30-0"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A cybered character may acquire up to two Hidden</span><span class="c6">Compartment</span><span class="c0">s.

A weapons compartment also should specify whether it is a ranged weapon that is concealed, or a melee weapon; HiddenCompartments are, as a rule, specifically-made for their user, and should be designed as such.

A HiddenCompartment designed to hold weapons can contain either a small built-in melee weapon or a small built-in ranged weapon and has no other purpose in passive mode, but its secrecy remains intact as normal.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Active Mode = </span><span class="c2 c0">The active mode for the HiddenCompartment applies to weapons only and has no effect for storage.

If a combat has already begun, the cybered character may choose to take a surprise round to attack with their weapon(s) before the next Amazing round in combat. For every BT spent, the cybered character rolls one extra die on their attack (Melee or Ranged), depending on what type of weapon they chose to occupy their compartment. The weapon&rsquo;s attack is the same as a normal unmodified Melee or Ranged weapon (see Gear description). After the surprise round, the cybered character can continue to use their weapon as a normal weapon for the duration of combat. Note that the character must spend at least one BT in order to be able to utilize their hidden weapon.</span></li></ul><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c7">Robo</span><span class="c1">Legs</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_30-0"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">A cybered character may acquire up to two RoboLegs. </span><span class="c2 c0">If a player has two RoboLegs, each counts towards their maximum limit of pieces of CyberWare; however, the passive effect listed is tripled rather than doubled.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Description = </span><span class="c2 c0">A RoboLeg is an artificial collection of metallic bones and joints, connected through a synthetic fibrous muscular system.

Coupled with the processing power of a NanComputer, CyberOptics are able to take and store photographs and videos (but the NanoComputer must be acquired separately). Additionally, CyberOptics expands the distance at which the cybered character can make an attack using the Ranged skill by 60 meters (for a total range of 180m versus 120m for non-cybered characters).</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Active Mode = </span><span class="c2 c0">In active mode, CyberOptics provide bonuses to Ranged and Search, respectively.

The following section is designed to help players and GMs &ldquo;flesh out&rdquo; their characters and NPCs. Ideals, traits, and bonds</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;are roleplaying items that try to make an actual &ldquo;character&rdquo; out of the character, rather than just a bunch of numbers.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ideals</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">A character should begin play with at least one but no more than two ideals. Ideals can be thought of as &ldquo;goals;&rdquo; what are the character&rsquo;s overriding goals? What motivates the character? What drives them to do what they do? A character&rsquo;s goals may change over the course of a campaign (and in such a case, the player should work with the GM to discuss the character&rsquo;s new ideals), but it establishes an overview of what the character wants. The sample ideal list below is by no means exhaustive, but it can be a starting point for players to choose their character&rsquo;s ideals.</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_36-0 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Evangelization: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character is driven to spread a message or an idea to others, preferably as many others as possible. Perhaps the character is a religious zealot, or a political revolutionary. In any case, they seek converts to their worldview.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Fun: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character&rsquo;s overriding goal is to experience pleasure in all of its varied forms. Everything this character does is designed to perpetuate their luxurious lifestyle, and to live their life to the fullest. </span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Love: </span><span class="c6">This character puts the person(s) they love before everything, and the well-being of those loved ones comes before all else, even the character&rsquo;s own well-being. This ideal suits characters who have romance, family (parents, siblings, or children), or who wish to reconcile with a loved one as a part of their character&rsquo;s background.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">More: </span><span class="c2 c0">A character with this ideal wants to acquire as much wealth and as many material possessions as they can. They want it all, and they are reluctant to share with the rest of the world. Perhaps this character is motivated to possess a certain object, or to collect only certain objects. Most importantly, why is the character driven by material wealth?</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Knowledge: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character is driven by the quest to discover. Perhaps the character is concerned with cosmic questions of good and evil, or with achieving a particular scientific or technological breakthrough. In any case, this character believes that by discovering the truth, they can ultimately better society, or can conversely use that knowledge to their exclusive advantage.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Power: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character craves clout. They have a lust for all the benefits and privileges that go with command, and the rest of the trappings of power. This character could be motivated by military rank, political influence, or technological power.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Survival: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character wants desperately to live, but there are forces at work which seek to destroy the character. This character may be a fugitive, a radical visionary, the last of a family or other group, or someone that can be exploited by others. They put their own survival ahead of other concerns.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Truth: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character is suspicious of the world in some way, and seeks to uncover the truth. Perhaps the character was the victim of a smear campaign, or has knowledge that a government or corporation has knowingly lied to the public. By seeking to uncover and publicize the truth, this character feels they can rectify some past wrong.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Vengeance: </span><span class="c2 c0">Someone (or something) committed a heinous wrong against this character in the past, and now the character is on a quest of revenge to right that wrong, no matter the costs.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Winning: </span><span class="c6">This character seeks to be the very best at what they do.

Their idol could perhaps be a family member, historical figure, religious figure, or celebrity, etc. The character constantly seeks to imitate their idol&rsquo;s behavior, and frequently brings up their idol in conversation, whether applicable or not.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Aggressive: </span><span class="c2 c0">&ldquo;Might makes right&rdquo; is this character&rsquo;s motto. Aggressive characters are unafraid to assert themselves intimidatingly or in &nbsp;a hostile fashion into situations.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Amicable: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character is easygoing and makes friends easily, regardless of sex, gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, etc. They know enough ice-breakers to make even the most obstinate adversary warm to them.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Apathetic: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character finds it very difficult to really care about anything. Maybe they believe that nothing matters in the end, or maybe they lack the knowledge to form opinions. Apathetic characters may be aloof, indifferent, or even cynical at times.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Brave: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character is unafraid to stand their ground, even against insurmountable odds, regardless of the situation or consequences. Brave characters believe that their power exists to help those who are less fortunate, and that heroes are needed. They often emulate romantic ideas of medieval knights, swashbucklers, or Wild West lawmen.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Calm: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character remains calm in almost every situation, and rarely raises their voice or succumbs to emotions, even in world-shattering cases. They have an even-keeled perception of the world.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Careless: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character has a penchant for breaking things and for getting into accidents. For some reason they find it difficult keeping their hands to themselves, and will trip or stumble at the slightest impediment.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Celebrity: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character is well-known in certain circles (art, music, craftsmanship, politics, etc.). They can capitalize on their fame in many cases, but they are easily offended when they encounter someone who does not know of or appreciate their fame.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Charmer:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;This character has perfected the art of &ldquo;kissing ass,&rdquo; or &ldquo;brownnosing&rdquo; to get what they want. They are always spewing flattering statements and compliments, especially when they can gain or benefit by doing so.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Confident: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character has a good sense of their abilities and shortcomings, and they also try to encourage others to be more confident in their abilities.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Conformist: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character is a &ldquo;team player.&rdquo; A conformist character does not like to &ldquo;stick out,&rdquo; and will do almost anything to blend in (clothing, politics, customs, etc.). They do not speak up or cause trouble, but simply &ldquo;go with the flow.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Corrupt: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character lives by a moral code which emphasizes their personal gain above all other considerations. A corrupt character may still engage in noble or worthy acts as long as it advances their agenda.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Cowardly: </span><span class="c2 c0">A cowardly character displays fear in the face of adversity, and will flee or avoid danger in most cases.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Defiant: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character has a tendency to defy authority. They sometimes choose not to see the true situation due to their defiance, and often run afoul of legal or political authorities.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Despicable: </span><span class="c2 c0">A despicable character has no moral compass whatsoever; they are twisted, evil, or possibly insane. Their behaviors may be erratic, or may be cool and calculating. They enjoy seeing others in pain and hold no regard for any authority other than their own.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Determined: </span><span class="c2 c0">When this character sets their mind to something, virtually nothing is capable of standing in their way to accomplish said goal.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Doer: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character tends to be introverted and quiet, choosing instead to make their mind known by their deeds. They tend to judge others in the same way, by actions rather than speeches.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Ear-To-The-Ground: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character has a keen tendency to gather rumors and gossip wherever they go. </span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Egalitarian: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character truly sees others as their equal, regardless of sex, gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, etc.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Energetic: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character is vigorous, full of vitality, and possessed of an intensity of expression.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Fair: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character has an apt sense of fairness, and always tries to solve problems by what seems &ldquo;fair&rdquo; or &ldquo;just.&rdquo;</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Fatalist: </span><span class="c2 c0">To this character, everything happens for a reason, and they are disinclined to intervene in what they see as events taking their preordained course.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Generous: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character is giving of their money, time, and talents to the point where they can sometimes become impoverished.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Hateful: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character possesses a deep-seeded hatred against a person, group, place, thing, or organization.

They doubt, question, and usually don&rsquo;t want to believe anything at face value.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Snob: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character is an aficionado of something: food, wine, art, music, etc., and looks down on others who do not share their &ldquo;expert&rdquo; opinion.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Storyteller: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character is familiar with a specific cultural or religious body of knowledge, and frequently references or quotes stories and passages that apply or provide insight to various situations.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Tempestuous: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character undergoes many mood swings, oftentimes for no good reason.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Thinker: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character is so focused on their inner mind, ideas, and its workings, that they often ignore what is going on in the world outside them.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Tolerant: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character is accepting of nearly all viewpoints, religions, and lifestyles, and does not pass judgment on those who differ from their view of the norm.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Traumatized: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character has experienced things that few others have; as a result, they experience intense anxiety when presented with similar situations.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Trusting: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character is extremely gullible, and is inclined to believe or confide in anyone readily, without doubt or hesitation.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Uncivilized: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character has been (un)intentionally raised in situations that deemphasize or delegitimize social graces. As a result, they often eat and act like animals in such such situations.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Untrusting: </span><span class="c2 c0">This character finds it hard to place trust in others, even those that they have known for a long time.

Bonds may be positive in nature</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;(i.e. the character is deeply grateful to their former military unit for their comradeship in combat) or negative (i.e. the character owes a significant debt to a criminal organization). In all cases, bonds establish a character&rsquo;s relationship with the rest of the world. </span><span class="c0">It is recommended that characters begin play with one strong bond, and perhaps one or two weaker bonds. These help establish a character&rsquo;s backstory, and ground the character in the world.

The Animals skill is used in cases where a character is trying to ride, handle, befriend (or not be eaten by) an animal, or when a character is attempting to train an intelligent, domesticated animal to perform certain tasks. Factual information on the animals (i.e. their diets, habitats, etc.) are academic knowledge, and therefore would be best rolled by using the Outdoors skill using INT as the attribute (see Outdoors for more information).</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Expertise Perks:</span></li></ul><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_14-1 start"><li class="c3 c20 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Animal Companion: </span></li></ul><p class="c3 c4 c23"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Athletics &ndash; FORT</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_14-0"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">This is the &ldquo;default&rdquo; FORT check, and in cases where the GM decides on such a check, Athletics will be rolled.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">An Athletics check is rolled when the character attempts to use strength or speed to accomplish a task.

It is assumed that all characters have a basic understanding of computer technology, as it is ubiquitous in the world; however, characters who use Computers are able to make even ordinary devices perform above what the untrained can do. For instance, while every character would be able to use basic functions on a computer (search, save, delete, communicate, etc.), by using Computers a character is able to hack into a computer system, or to re-write computer code to their liking.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Gear &ndash; Personal Computer: </span><span class="c0">A character trained in Computers has a small personal </span><span class="c6">computer</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that has capabilities not found in other normal devices. Most notably, a </span><span class="c6">personal computer</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;can be used to hack into other computer or electronic systems wirelessly to a range of 30m.

A wireless hack imposes DA to the Computers check, but if the character physically connects their </span><span class="c6">device</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;to a computer or electronic lock being hacked via wires, the roll is done as normal. </span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Expertise Perks:</span></li></ul><p class="c3 c4 c23"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Deception &ndash; PERS</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_14-0"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">When a character chooses to knowingly lie or deceiv</span><span class="c6">e</span><span class="c0">, a Deception check is made. A successful roll means that the target believes the character&rsquo;s lie until there is a change in the situation, at which point the character may need to re-roll the Deception check (depending on circumstances). A character may attempt to use Deception against multiple targets (up to their PERS score) using the same action, but each check needs to be rolled separately. It is imp</span><span class="c6">ortant to note that if and when an NPC discovers that they have been lied to, their attitude towards the character will probably lessen, making further interactions more difficult.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Gear &ndash; Fashion Suit: </span><span class="c6">The fashion suit is an assemblage of clothing, shoes, accessories, etc. that emit an aura of confidence and belonging.

Endurance checks are made in cases where a character is trying to resist adverse environments, such as extreme cold or heat, or when a character is fighting off disease or infection. Endurance checks can also be made to determine whether or not a character is able to continue with physically strenuous work, such as running a marathon. A success on an Endurance check generally means that the character is unaffected by the challenge and may continue to take actions as normal until the GM decides otherwise. A failure generally means that the character succumbs to the physical challenge, and suffers the consequences as dictated by the situation. Finally, a character may make an Endurance check during a rest to restore 1 point of body durability.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Gear &ndash; Armor: </span><span class="c0">A character trained in Endurance has body armor that protects against physical damage. Armor soaks 1d6 LI/1d3 HI/1d6 EN damage. It has no soaking ability versus ME damage. The body armor is akin to a bulletproof vest in its general mass and bulkiness. It can be concealed at range by clothing, but any observers within 6 meters of the character can identify the armor within 1 minute. A character wearing armor has DA to Acrobatics, Athletics, Stealth, and Thievery checks. </span><span class="c6">Tesa characters have a natural &ldquo;Armor&rdquo; due to their scales which does not impose penalties on the aforementioned skill checks.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Gear &ndash;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6 c7 c13">E-Suit: </span><span class="c6">The E-Suit (short for &ldquo;environment suit&rdquo;) better enables the character to withstand environmental extremes (heat, cold, low oxygen, etc.). The E-Suit is sort of a combination between a hazmat suit, a scuba suit, and a lightweight spacesuit. E-Suits are not normal fashion, so it&rsquo;s obvious that a character is wearing one (though the appearance could be improved by spending further XP). The first time the GM calls for an Endurance check to resist the environment, a character with an E-Suit rolls their check with advantage. Any level of success allows the character to continue rolling with advantage thereafter. Any failure results mean that the suit is incapable of handling the extremes and ceases to function until the character takes a rest, or until the GM awards a milestone. The E-Suit is also equipped with a respirator that can be used in space or underwater, or to mitigate the effects of smoke or toxins, for 10 minutes per milestone. </span><span class="c2 c0">This is the same E-Suit granted by training in the Outdoors skill.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Expertise Perks:</span></li></ul><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c7 c13">H</span><span class="c6 c7">umanities</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&ndash; INT</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_14-0"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">Humanities is a knowledge skill that reflects a character&rsquo;s familiarity with the past, historical events, patterns of human behavior, art, literature, music, and other liberal studies in general. A successful Humanities check means the character has successfully recalled or applied knowledge about the past, human societies, artwork, mythology, literature, theatre, or other questions of psychology and economics.

The character may be adept at diagnosing medical problems, and may potentially have first aid training, or be able to treat disease or illness. A successful use of Medicine is generally used outside of combat, and means that the character has succeeded (at least temporarily) in their efforts to diagnose or treat themselves or others.

The medkit is roughly the size and shape of a book, and contains an assortment of pharmaceuticals, bandages, surgical tools, etc. There are enough supplies in each medkit to be used up to three </span><span class="c6">times per milestone, and upon reaching a milestone, the medkit is &ldquo;recharged.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">The medkit can be used in a combat scene with a Medicine check to restore up to 2d6 stun damage to an individual.

A successful skill check to repair (which requires a rest) results in the desired piece of equipment becoming functional again. Alternatively, a character may use Technology to &ldquo;jury-rig&rdquo; a broken device. Jury-rigging requires two combat actions, and results in the desired device becoming functional for another 1d6 hours, after which the device breaks again and cannot be used until repaired as normal during a rest. Using Repair to fix damaged CyberWare imposes DA on the skill check. Additionally, Technology is also important for cybered characters.

Training in vehicles also allows characters to operate specialty craft that most civilians have no familiarity with, such as jet-skis or personal aircraft. When a character operating a vehicle attempts a vehicular maneuver out of the ordinary, the GM will call for a check. On a successful roll, the maneuver succeeds. </span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Gear &ndash; Personal Vehicle: </span><span class="c6">The character is in possession of a small, one-person capacity personal vehicle.

it is likely that characters take damage. There are four damage types:</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_14-0"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Low-Impact (LI) Damage: </span><span class="c0">This is damage caused by things such as melee attacks and other </span><span class="c6">subsonic</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;projectiles. Armor is generally effective at blocking this type of damage.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">High-Impact (HI) Damage:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;This is damage caused by high-velocity projectiles, such as ranged weapon attacks and explosions. Armor is less-effective at blocking HI damage, but it is better than nothing.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Energy (EN) Damage: </span><span class="c0">This is damage caused by varied forms of energy, like fire, electricity, extreme cold, psion</span><span class="c6">ic energy, </span><span class="c0">etc. Armor is generally effective at blocking this damage, but ce</span><span class="c6">rtain types of energy may be more or less harmful to your character, depending on different situations</span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Mental (ME) Damage: </span><span class="c2 c0">This is damage caused by some psionic powers and mental strain as dictated by the GM. No type of armor or shield can block ME damage.</span></li></ul><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Armor and Soaking Damage</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">Characters who wear Armor, or who have other means of protection, can absorb some or all of the damage they receive. The Armor provided in the Gear section has a rating of 1d6 LI/1d3 HI/1d6 EN, meaning that if the character would receive low-impact (LI) damage, they would first roll 1d6 to see how much of that damage would be soaked by their armor. Any remaining damage would be incurred to the character as normal. Note that soaking damage using armor has no effect on secondary damage (see below), nor does Armor protect against mental (ME) damage. A character can generally only benefit from Armor once, although some rare circumstances may allow multiple ways to absorb harm.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Secondary Damage</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">When a character incurs BODY damage, they may also incur some STUN damage by the sheer impact of the damage; this is known as secondary damage. For every 3 points of BODY damage that a character takes from a single source, they also take 1 additional point of STUN damage secondarily. This secondary damage follows the normal rules of rounding in the characters&rsquo; favors, so an attack that deals 5 BODY damage would only deal 1 additional STUN damage. Armor is not effective at absorbing secondary damage.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Knockouts</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">As mentioned above, a character is knocked unconscious when their STUN durability rating drops to zero. A character who is knocked out cannot take any actions, and any attacks targeted against them automatically succeed. A character remains unconscious for 6 combat phases (30 seconds) beginning the phase immediately after the knockout, after which the character can begin making Endurance checks in order to regain consciousness. A character who regains consciousness in this fashion also regains STUN durability equal to their FORT+PERS. Unconscious characters who continue to receive physical damage (low-impact, high-impact, or energy) incur all damage to their remaining BODY durability. (Since mental damage only affects STUN, an unconscious character does not suffer mental damage.)</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Early Knockouts</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">Some attacks are so powerful that, in addition to causing secondary damage, they run the risk of knocking characters out, even if their STUN durability is well above zero. If a character ever incurs damage equal to or greater than one-third of their total </span><span class="c6 c7">remaining durability</span><span class="c2 c0">, they run the risk of an early knockout. In such a case, after taking the requisite damage, the character in question would either roll an Endurance check (for BODY damage) or a Resolve check (for STUN damage). Any success on those checks means that the character remains conscious. A Failure would result in the character losing their remaining STUN durability points and falling unconscious (see &ldquo;Knockouts&rdquo; above).</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">GEAR AND MONEY</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">In a modern-to-far future game, technology and gear are parts of everyday life. However, the Teleios game is designed as a storytelling game, and as such does not contain detailed rules for encumbrance, etc. All characters are assumed to have personal effects such as clothing, keys, a communication device, a wallet/bankchip, etc. Above and beyond those base essentials, it is assumed that characters have a residence of some type, and some means of employment. In other words, it is encouraged for GMs to not spend any time tracking how characters pay for each meal (assume that they have food to eat unless the story dictates otherwise), and spend more time focusing on the plot and story of the adventure. Any Gear that characters acquire and/or improve costs XP, so GMs should generally allow players to deck their characters out with whatever items they choose (they&rsquo;ve paid for it, after all). It should also be rare for a player to NOT have access to an item of Gear for which they have paid XP; generally only a good story reason should restrict a character&rsquo;s access to their items (theft of a unique weapon, damage to a character&rsquo;s vehicle in a close firefight, etc.). Of course, such story reasons can be launch points for great adventures (how to recover said weapon, or how to repair the damaged vehicle).</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6 c7 c13">GEAR DESCRIPTIONS</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Armor - Endurance</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">A character trained in Endurance has body armor that protects against physical damage. Armor soaks 1d6 LI/1d3 HI/1d6 EN damage. It has no soaking ability versus ME damage. The body armor is akin to a bulletproof vest in its general mass and bulkiness. It can be concealed at range by clothing, but any observers within 6 meters of the character can identify the armor within 1 minute. A character wearing armor has DA to Acrobatics, Athletics, Stealth, and Thievery checks. Tesa characters have a natural &ldquo;Armor&rdquo; due to their scales which does not impose penalties on the aforementioned skill checks.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">E-Suit - Endurance, Outdoors </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The E-Suit (short for &ldquo;environment suit&rdquo;) better enables the character to withstand environmental extremes (heat, cold, low oxygen, etc.). The E-Suit is sort of a combination between a hazmat suit, a scuba suit, and a lightweight spacesuit. E-Suits are not normal fashion, so it&rsquo;s obvious that a character is wearing one (though the appearance could be improved by spending further XP). The first time the GM calls for an Endurance check to resist the environment, a character with an E-Suit rolls their check with advantage. Any level of success allows the character to continue rolling with advantage thereafter. Any failure results mean that the suit is incapable of handling the extremes and ceases to function until the character takes a rest, or until the GM awards a milestone. The E-Suit is also equipped with a respirator that can be used in space or underwater, or to mitigate the effects of smoke or toxins, for 10 minutes per milestone. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Explosives Kit - Tactics</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The explosives kit comes in two separate forms: as a satchel charge or as three small grenades. The character who acquires an explosives kit must specify which kit they choose. Each kit may be &ldquo;recharged,&rdquo; so to speak, once per milestone. At each milestone a character may &ldquo;swap&rdquo; a satchel charge for three grenades, or vice versa. The satchel charge may be used as part of a Tactics check to destroy a large vehicle or small building. Each grenade may be used as a thrown weapon (see the Ranged skill) which deals 2d6 (HI) body damage for a fragmentation grenade or 3d6 (LI) stun damage for a concussion grenade. The player must choose which damage to deal before making the Ranged check. Other types of grenades may be available by spending XP to improve the gear. The satchel charge is the general size and mass of a briefcase and can be easily disguised as such from the outside. The three grenades are the size and mass of baseballs and can be easily concealed by clothing.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Fashion Suit - Bureaucracy, Charm, Deception, Streetwise</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The fashion suit is an assemblage of clothing, shoes, accessories, etc. that emit an aura of confidence and belonging. The suit can also superficially change colors, emit pleasing (or unpleasing odors), and can enable a character to &ldquo;fit in&rdquo; in certain locales. The Fashion Suit grants advantage on Bureaucracy, Charm, Deception, and Streetwise checks in situations where personal dress and physical appearance may play a role. The player must declare their intent to modify their Fashion Suit before such an event. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Forensics Kit - Science, Search</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The forensics kit includes inks, dyes, powders, and other tools useful to investigators of all types, including police, detectives, and other operatives. The forensics kit is roughly the size and shape of a book, and grants a character AD on Search checks when used to find minute details in a scene, and can also provide much more detailed information than would otherwise be possible (for example, that the crime was committed by a male with black hair, rather than simply a crime was committed by a person standing 1.8 meters tall). Using the forensics kit requires 30 minutes, and so cannot be used in a combat scene. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Lockpick Set - Thievery</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">The lockpick set consists of physical and electronic devices which facilitate lockpicking and illicit entry. The lockpick set itself is roughly the size and shape of a small book. Use of the lockpick set grants AD to lockpicking physical locks, and negates the DA imposed on electronic locks. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Medical Kit - Medicine</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">A character trained in Medicine has a small medical kit (&ldquo;medkit&rdquo; for short) that can be used to restore damage in themselves or in others in and out of combat scenarios. The medkit is roughly the size and shape of a book, and contains an assortment of pharmaceuticals, bandages, surgical tools, etc. There are enough supplies in each medkit to be used up to three times per milestone, and upon reaching a milestone, the medkit is &ldquo;recharged.&rdquo; The medkit can be used in a combat scene with a Medicine check to restore up to 2d6 stun damage to an individual. Doing so in combat requires 2 actions (for a minimum of 2 combat phases). During a rest, the medkit can be used to restore up to 1d6 body damage. Note that this is in addition to any durability gained by characters through the Endurance skill. If a character tries to use a medkit on themselves, they suffer DA to the Medicine check.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Melee Weapon - Melee</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">A character trained in Melee has a melee weapon that can be used as an action in combat. The melee weapon deals 1d6+FORT (LI) body damage, or 2d6+FORT (LI) stun damage. The character chooses which damage type to deal when using the weapon and before making the Melee check. The exact weapon the character uses can vary from player to player, but melee weapons are able to be used one-handed. They are capable of striking an enemy that the character is adjacent to (within 1 meter). The melee weapon is obvious to onlookers and cannot be successfully hidden. Melee weapons do not produce noise at great distances.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Personal Computer - Computers </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">A character trained in Computers has a small personal computer that has capabilities not found in other normal devices. Most notably, a personal computer can be used to hack into other computer or electronic systems wirelessly to a range of 30m. A character&rsquo;s device can vary to suit the player, but they are generally small, thin, hand-held machines. A wireless hack imposes DA to the Computers check, but if the character physically connects their device to a computer or electronic lock being hacked via wires, the roll is done as normal. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Personal Vehicle - Vehicles</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">The character is in possession of a small, one-person capacity personal vehicle. This vehicle is generally designed for land usage, but can be modified to travel in the air, the water, or in space for extra XP. The personal vehicle provides very little in the way of physical protection (think of a motorcycle), but can enable the character to travel independently at need.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Psionic Detector - Occult, Science</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">The psionic detector is a small device that looks similar to a normal personal computer or communication device. If any psionic power is used (or is in use) within 30 meters, the detector will alert and will pinpoint the general direction of the usage. Note that this includes any active psionic powers from the character themselves, or any allies. If the character is actively monitoring the detector, any usage of a psionic power will pinpoint the individual who used the power. The carrying character may voluntarily choose to &ldquo;switch off&rdquo; the detector and remain ignorant to psionic activity in their surroundings.</span><span class="c6 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">A character may choose to combine their Psionic Detector into one device along with their personal communicator or other devices (provided that they have paid 1 XP each to get each Gear item). </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Psionic Shield - Occult</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">The psionic shield is a small device that looks similar to a normal personal computer or communication device. It may be used in one of two ways; first, if worn or carried by a character, it either imposes DA on any psionic power used within 30 meters (for characters) or grants the carrying character AD on defense checks to resist psionic attacks (for NPCs). The carrying character may voluntarily choose to &ldquo;switch off&rdquo; the shield and ignore these penalties and advantages. Alternatively, the psionic shield may be &ldquo;clamped&rdquo; onto an individual (restraints and modifications may be made to fit around an individual&rsquo;s neck). In such a case the individual to whom it is attached may not use psionic powers while the device is active.</span><span class="c6 c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">A character may choose to combine their Psionic Shield into one device along with their personal communicator or other devices (provided that they have paid 1 XP each to get each Gear item).</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Ranged Weapon - Ranged</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6">A character trained in Ranged has a ranged weapon that can be used as an action in combat. The ranged weapon deals 2d6 (HI) body damage on a successful check result. Ranged weapons may target anything within 120m of the character (provided there are no obstructions), and require two hands to use. The ranged weapon is obvious to onlookers and cannot be hidden. Ranged weapons create noise when used, and listeners within 360m of the character are able to hear it clearly.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Repair Kit - Technology</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The repair kit includes tools and electronics which are useful in fixing damaged technological or electronic devices. The kit itself is about the size and shape of a book. Using the repair kit outside of combat reduces the time to fix items to 1 hour, rather than 1d6 hours. When using the Repair Kit to jury-rig, it provides AD on the related Technology check. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Science Kit - Science</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">A character trained in Science has a small science kit that enables them to conduct scientific lab work and fieldwork when an actual lab is not present. The science kit is roughly the size and shape of a briefcase, and contains vials, test tubes, chemical bases and solvents, etc. Using a science kit grants a character AD on Science checks when a physical sample is available to study (mineral, tissue, etc.). The use of a science kit in this way takes 30 minutes, and so is not available during a combat encounter.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Sensor Array - Science, Search, Technology</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The sensor array is an electronic device that detects a large quantity of environmental data, such as temperature, humidity, UV radiation, electromagnetic radiation, infrared, etc. The sensor array itself is a device similar to a regular computer or communication device carried by most people. Using the sensor array outside of a combat scene (which requires 3 minutes) grants the character a wealth of knowledge about their immediate environment, up to 120 meters away. It can also provide AD on the Search skill when used to detect larger-scale environmental features in a scene.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Stealth Unit - Stealth</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The stealth unit is a small electronic device in similar size and shape to a regular computer or communication device carried by most people. The stealth device includes sound-dampening technology and projects image-blurring which grants a character with this device AD on Stealth checks. If a character using a stealth unit remains quiet and motionless, they cannot be detected. Any motion or noise would trigger another Stealth check, but with AD. The character can choose to turn this device on and off.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Survival Kit - Outdoors</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The survival kit is a small briefcase-sized kit which contains emergency supplies that are useful in the wilderness. It contains a variety of dried foodstuffs, water purification tablets, emergency blankets, lamps, heaters, and navigational tools. A character who makes an Outdoors check while in possession of a survival kit (depending on situation) will receive AD on the check.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">STANDARD PHYSICAL ABILITIES</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The standards listed below are the maximum values in each category for each character. CyberWare adds to these standard abilities (see CyberWare for more information). Any attempts to perform physical feats within these parameters may necessitate an Athletics, Acrobatics, or Endurance check (GM discretion), and even so, may not be possible.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_cvvpt81c1klm-0 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7 c13">Standing Jump: </span><span class="c2 c0">A standing jump measures the horizontal distance a character can leap from a standstill position.

Native to the planet Aleer, Android history tells of a time when their species had no advanced technology, and they called themselves simply the &ldquo;Aleer.&rdquo; Since those now-forgotten days, however, Aleer scientists, geneticists, and technicians were able to advance nanotechnology to the point where the entire species now has synthetic elements blended into their tissues. (Note that the term &ldquo;Android&rdquo; was given to this species by Humans and is now a widely accepted parlance, but that among their own kind the Aleer prefer the term &ldquo;Aleer.&rdquo;) From a distance it can be difficult to tell the difference between Androids and Humans; Aleer are roughly the same height and weight as Humans, and biological sexual differences between males and females follow Human patterns as well. At closer range, the differences between the species are evident. Android &ldquo;skin&rdquo; can be of any color (and some of the more flamboyant Androids opt in for multi-colored skin as well) and interlaced with nanocircuitry and other cyber enhancements. They are completely hairless on their bodies, and what passes for &ldquo;hair&rdquo; on the tops of their heads is actually a dense network of cables, fibers, and other synthetic devices. Their eyes, when not enhanced with cyber gear, consist of small pupils with gray or silver irises. Most androids do not wear external clothing among their own kind, choosing instead to augment their outward appearances with glowing tattoos, armored plates, or other appendages. However, for modesty in the company of non-Aleer, most Androids will wear clothing. Androids have the following characteristics where the game is concerned:</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_9-0 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Androids begin play with a free NanoC</span><span class="c0">omputer</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;(see CyberWare for more information). Note that Android characters must still spend batteries when activating this piece of CyberWare, and it otherwise functions as normal. This CyberWare is considered &ldquo;free&rdquo; in that an Android character with a FORT of 1 could still purchase an additional piece of CyberWare as normal above and beyond this starting piece.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Androids can acquire up to 7 pieces of CyberWare instead of 6. </span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Androids begin play with one free rank in Computers. If a player wishes their Android character to begin play with further ranks, they may purchase them as normal. An Android character cannot begin play with a rank higher than 4 in Computers.</span></li></ul><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Fraal</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">The Fraal are an ancient spacefaring species whose history is long and convoluted. According to their history, a great colony ship was dispatched from their home planet generations ago. In the course of their centuries-long interstellar journey, technical complications followed by civil unrest resulted in the loss of their own history. The location of their home planet, as well as their purpose in setting out to begin with, were all lost. It was in such a circumstance that the first Fraal made contact with the galactic community, and the now-dispossessed Fraal integrated into the Ekumen. Fraal are taller than Humans, with the shortest Fraal standing at nearly 2 meters tall. However, the Fraal are not a muscular species, being seen as &ldquo;wispy&rdquo; and &ldquo;frail&rdquo; by non-Fraal. Fraal have silky-smooth black hair on their heads, which is commonly braided into intricate patterns denoting status and rank. They have no other body hair whatsoever, and their skin is pale and smooth. Fraal eyes are large, oval, and nearly jet-black. They tend to be slow and deliberate in their movements, but that belies a steady determination and a quick response when necessary. All Fraal are technically intersex due to the fact that individuals possess both male and female sexual organs. As such, Fraal have no terms in their language for &ldquo;male&rdquo; or &ldquo;female,&rdquo; let alone gendered pronouns such as &ldquo;he&rdquo; or &ldquo;she.&rdquo; The reproductive cycle of Fraal is mysterious to non-Fraal, giving rise to rumors that young Fraal are seeded in laboratories and then incubated in embryonic tanks. Above all, the Fraal are distinguished by their psionic ability. Even the least-talented Fraal has some telepathic ability, and the greatest are sought as teachers of psionic skills to others. Fraal have the following characteristics where the game is concerned:</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_10-0 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Fraal begin play with one free rank in the psionic power Telepathy. Furthermore, Fraal Telepathy is superior in that Fraal do not need to see their intended target(s), though they are still limited by the 120 meter range. Finally, Fraal </span><span class="c6 c7">do not</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;expend psychovolts when using Telepathy in this way (though Fraal characters who obtain Expertise Perks in Telepathy may be required to spend PV when using those powers). Telepathy is considered &ldquo;free&rdquo; in that a </span><span class="c6">Fraal</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;character with a PSI of 0 could still use Telepathy even though they do not possess any other psionic powers. &nbsp;Fraal character can purchase an additional psionic power as normal above and beyond this starting power. All other rules about Telepathy apply as normal.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Fraal can acquire up to 7 psionic powers instead of 6.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Fraal begin play with one free rank in Occult.

Suffice to say that the Human drive to explore, dominate, and spread continues as the species expands into space. The Human spirit of ingenuity and diversity is appreciated by the Ekumen, and Humans are by far the most numerous of the species found in space. Humans have the following characteristics where the game is concerned:</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_11-0 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">Humans are very versatile, and have 6 extra XP to spend when starting a new character. These 6 extra XP are in addition to the starting XP that all characters calculate (see Character Creation for more information).</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">When Human characters spend Luck points to reroll dice, if they still do not like the result, they can choose to keep the luck point and take the worse outcome of the two rolls, even if the results are the same.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">Humans begin play with one free rank in Charm.

Native to a dense and dark jungle planet, Sheya, the Sesheyan are most at home when hiding and hunting in the dark. </span><span class="c6">Sesheyans</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;stand slightly smaller than humans, averaging around 1.5 meters in height. They are a completely hairless species, and their skin resembles shark skin in tone and texture more than any other (gray and sandpaper-like). </span><span class="c6">Sesheyans</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;are masters in dark environments, having six small, round, black eyes situated on an oblong &ldquo;face,&rdquo; much like a spider. Their bodies are lithe and muscular, and non-Sesheyan are at a loss to determine differences between males and females, though there are distinct sexual differences to the trained eye. The most pronounced feature of Sesheyans, however, is their set of bat-like wings, which have a 2-meter wingspan. Using these wings, </span><span class="c6">Sesheyans</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;are able to soundlessly glide and fly at moderate speeds. Sesheyans have the following characteristics where the game is concerned:</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_11-0"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Sesheyan characters have an additional movement type: flying. Sesheyans can fly and glide at the same rate as they can walk and swim (FORT+AGI meters/phase) in normal atmospheric conditions. If a Sesheyan character tries to perform a difficult maneuver while in flight, an Acrobatics check may be necessary.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Sesheyans</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;have extraordinary photoreceptors, and can see in absolute darkness and require no special technology or sensors to do so. Note that this special vision is independent of thermal, infrared, or other types of vision that can be detected by technology.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Sesheyans</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;begin play with one free rank in Stealth. If a player wishes their </span><span class="c6">Sesheyan</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;character to begin play with further ranks, they may purchase them as normal.

Tesa are a reptilian species slightly smaller than Humans (averaging 1.5 meters tall, though females are slightly larger). To Humans, Tesa bring to mind various types of geckos, chameleons, and lizards in their physiology and coloring (though Tesa females are generally brighter and more vibrant than males). The Tesa originated in an area of the galaxy with five nearby stars (known as the Tesa Cluster). In the course of the development of Tesa civilization, cryogenic technology was perfected to the point where the Tesa had colonized all five of these star systems using conventional starship engines (no stardrives) before encountering galactic civilization at large. Tesa are nothing if not curious and intelligent, especially where technology is concerned. Tesa have the following characteristics where the game is concerned:</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_12-0 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Tesa characters have reptilian scales which function as natural Armor (see Gear descriptions for more details). However, Tesa characters do not suffer DA on Acrobatics, Athletics, Stealth, and Thievery checks since the benefit is natural.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Tesa are quick to act, and so roll AD on all INIT checks.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Tesa begin play with one free rank in Technology.

Native to the planet Kurg, the history of the Weren species is filled with courageous battles, betrayals, conquests, and defeats. In Weren culture, the highest positions one can ascribe to (whether male or female) are to be warrior or shaman. Even the shortest Werens stand over 2 meters tall, and they can top out around 3 meters, with females only slightly shorter than males. Furthermore, Werens are built for combat, with strong, sturdy muscular bodies covered in thick fur. Weren fur varies in hue as does Human skin color, and Weren eyes also resemble Human eyes in shape and color. Most Werens do not wear clothing, letting their thick fur bear witness to their prowess; sexual organs are concealed beneath their thick fur regardless. Werens have the following characteristics where the game is concerned:</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_13-0 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">Werens have sharp claws on the ends of their hands which function as a natural Melee Weapon (see Gear descriptions for more details). And, because of the great size of Werens, they are able to attack a target within 2 meters with their claws, rather than 1.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">A Weren&rsquo;s fur has a natural shimmer and shine which gives them AD on any physical defense roll versus a ranged attack.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c2 c0">Werens begin play with one free rank in Melee. If a player wishes their Weren character to begin play with further ranks, they may purchase them as normal.

The Solar year is 2775 and the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy has been thoroughly explored and colonized, though new frontiers on all reaches of space continue to provide opportunities for the adventurous. Life in the galaxy is plentiful, and Humanity has encountered five other intelligent and sentient species. The galactic community as a whole is referred to as the &ldquo;Ekumen,&rdquo; but political unity is hard to come by. Numerous states and factions vie for dominance in the reaches of space. </span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_9qzg1ekytfzs-0 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Gravitics: </span><span class="c2 c0">Gravitics (or gravity technology) is a key element of life in 2775. Spaceships and stations are able to have artificial gravity for the benefit of their inhabitants, and sub-light propulsion is done through gravitic technology by tricking ships to &ldquo;fall&rdquo; forward through space.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Fusion:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;Nuclear fusion has supplied the Ekumen with a virtually limitless supply of energy, and safe fusion reactors power everything from cities to ships. That said, accidents can happen, and spent nuclear fuel is a now-common hazard.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Stardrive: </span><span class="c2 c0">The key piece of technology that defines this campaign is the stardrive, an engine that permits faster-than-light travel. The stardrive combines both gravitics and fusion technology, opening a rift in the fabric of space that connects two distant points. The bigger the stardrive (which also requires more energy to operate), the farther distance traveled, but only massive ships and space stations can power and carry a stardrive of large size. The smallest ships equipped with stardrives (luxury yachts and small freighters) generally have a distance range of up to 6 light years, while the biggest ships (military dreadnoughts and city-ships) can travel up to 36 light years in a single &ldquo;jump.&rdquo; Smaller spacecraft such as fighters and other personal ships are not equipped with stardrives; those ships must hitch a ride in a larger vessel in order to cross the galaxy. Ships that travel using a stardrive leave regular space in a colorful flash and enter what is called &ldquo;drivespace.&rdquo; While in drivespace, a ship is essentially stationary. Looking out a viewing port or window reveals a random kaleidoscope of colors, the meanings of which vary depending on the religion or philosophy of the traveler. Drivespace is also a dangerous place to be, however; ships must ensure that their hulls and airlocks are sealed prior to engaging the stardrive to prevent the stuff of drivespace from entering. Ships that have opened airlocks while in drivespace are never heard from again. A journey through drivespace always takes exactly 216 Solar hours (9 Solar days) regardless of distance traveled. Therefore, ships making jumps need to be well-prepared with food, water, and berthing for passengers. Upon emerging from drivespace, a ship&rsquo;s stardrive must go through a period of &ldquo;cooling down&rdquo; before making another jump. For every lightyear traveled, the stardrive must cool down for 2 Solar hours. Stardrives can only operate by bending the fabric of space; attempting to activate a stardrive in an atmosphere will result in a nuclear explosion, the size of which is determined by the size of the stardrive..</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Ansible: </span><span class="c2 c0">The ansible is a technology that permits communication between star systems. These types of communication include radio and electrical signals, but they do not have mass, so they do not require a stardrive to be sent. The ansible uses gravitics to &ldquo;bundle&rdquo; these radio and electronic messages and send them at faster-than-light speed. Ansibles are large devices, but are found in most every structure and ship. They are generally too large to be carried by an individual. Messages sent by ansible travel at a speed of 1 lightyear every three Solar hours. Delayed messages and responses are essential facts of life in the far reaches of the galaxy. </span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Star Systems: </span><span class="c6">Due to the incredible distances between them, it requires a lot of time to communicate and travel from one star system to another. As such, each star system is quasi-independent. </span></li></ul><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">ENDARKENMENT CAMPAIGN</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2 c0">2212 CE. Earth. The Endarkenment. The specifics of the world will be (for the most part) collaboratively built between the players and the GM, but there are some facets of the world that are unchangeable:</span></p><ul class="c9 lst-kix_list_31-0 start"><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Climate Change: </span><span class="c2 c0">The absolute worst-case scenarios of climate change have come true, and then some. Global temperatures have risen and weather patterns have altered. All glaciers around the world have melted, raising seas to significant and devastating levels (65 meters above present sea levels). During the winter seasons in each hemisphere ocean ice appears, sometimes, but it quickly disappears upon summer temperatures. Weather patterns have changed around the world to affect agriculture and human life. The human cost of climate change has been unprecedented; wars, famine, species extinction, refugee crises, diseases, droughts, and more are commonplace. Lesser developed countries are more at risk of these consequences, but even first-world nations are dealing with climate-related issues. Needless to say the effects of climate change in 2212 are felt by everyone.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Psionics:</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;Psionic ability has manifested itself upon humanity. Some humans are innately born with abilities only heard of in myth and legend; others can later develop this ability with intense focus and training, under the tutelage of another psionic. Different nations, cultures, and religions view psionic ability differently, and have differing laws, policies, regulations, and attitudes towards psionics. In the general population psionics are rare, occurring in roughly one out of 200 births at random.</span></li><li class="c3 c12 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6 c7">Cyberware: </span><span class="c6">Technology has progressed to the point where human and machine can be effectively joined to create truly cybernetic persons. Nanotechnology has permitted circuitry to interweave with the nervous system, allowing for conscious control of computerized implants. Choosing to become &ldquo;cybered&rdquo; is an expensive and laborious process, generally available to only powerful governments, corporations, or to the very affluent (or the criminal).</span></li></ul></body></html>
